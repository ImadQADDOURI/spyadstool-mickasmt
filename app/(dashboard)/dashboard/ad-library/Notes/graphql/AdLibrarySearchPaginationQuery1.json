In seeking revenge, she entangled him but sacrificed her heart in the bargain!\n=====\nA bolt of lightning slashed through the rainy night, Brayden Davis paused briefly, his gaze indifferent a woman huddled against a stone pillar in the courtyard before he stepped over her.\n\"Brayden, please, you're my brother,\" a familiar voice pleaded, the woman's fingers tugging at his pant leg.\nHe glanced down at her, his expression cold. \"Kayley, I've told you, Roselyn is my only sister. You don't belong here.\"\n\nKayley Spencer's heart sank, but she couldn't refute his words.\n\nShe was a burden, an unwanted stepsister. She'd lost her place within the Davis family when her mother died.\n\nBesides, Brayden had never acknowledged their familial bond.\n\n\"I'm so sorry. I just... I need help,\" she stammered, her voice trembling.\n\nBrayden didn't respond. Through a flash of lightning, he saw her pale, fragile face clearly. Despite her pitiful appearance, she still looked undeniably beautiful... just as he remembered.\n\nAs he silently gazed down at her, Kayley tentatively withdrew her hand. \"I...\"\n\nHe had made his stance clear. She would have to pick up what remained of her dignity and face this alone.\n\nWith a forced smile, she pushed herself up, ignoring the pain in her ankle. \"Sorry to bother you, Mr. Davis. I'll leave now...\"\n\nBefore she could finish, he sc**ped her up and carried her into the villa.\n\nAs he lay her down, his hands accidentally brushing against her injured ankle.\n\nKayley winced, instinctively grabbing his suit, but stifled a cry.\n\nBrayden's eyes flashed. He cruelly squeezed her ankle.\n\nShe yelped. Tears streamed down her face as she begged, \"Please stop, it hurts!\"\n\nBrayden withdrew his hand and stood up, looking down at her.\n\nKayley had thought her pitiful state might evoke his sympathy, but all she got was a mocking laugh. \"How pathetic. After leaving the Davis family, you actually ended up like this.\"\n\nKayley clearly heard the taunts in his words but chose to ignore them. She braced herself and asked for his help, choking. \"I can't dance anymore. My leg was broken. The injury healed but the nerves are still damaged. The doctor said it can't fully heal.\"\n\nTears flowed freely as she vented her shattered dreams. \"Dancing is all I have left. It's the only way I can relive memories with my mother. Please, you're the best surgeon in the country. I believe you can cure me. Please...\"\n\nBrayden remained expressionless after hearing her pleas. He then sneered and asked, \"What's that got to do with me? Go to Aaron Harding.\"\n\nKayley's eyes widened. How could Brayden possibly know about Aaron?\n\nHad he been keeping an eye on her even after she left the Davis family?\n\nConfusion filled her as she glanced at Brayden. When he offered no explanation, she awkwardly admitted, \"We broke up. Aaron cheated on me with some rich woman.\"\n\nHe was behind her injury too, but revealing that would only invite more ridicule.\n\n\"Oh.\" Brayden's enigmatic smile held no clues. \"I stopped doing surgeries three years ago to focus on the family business,\" he stated. \"You should find someone else.\"\n\nFeeling flustered, Kayley lunged forward, grasping his arm, pleading, \"Brayden, please! You're the only one who can help me. I'll do anything.\"\n\nHis gaze swept over her hand on his arm, a sneer twisting his lips. \"Trying again, like three years ago, huh?\"\n\nShe quickly pulled back, stammering an explanation. \"No, I'm just...\"\n\n\"Kayley, is that all you can do?\" he interrupted, his eyes locking onto hers. \n\nShock washed over Kayley. Did he want her to continue?\n\nBut... she thought he despised her.\n\nShe had a lot of questions but no answers. There was only one way forward if she wanted to heal her leg. She stood on her tiptoes, grabbing his clothes...\n\n\"Brayden, are you home?\" Suddenly, a voice called from outside. It was Roselyn Davis, his sister.\n\nPanic surged through Kayley as she tried to escape, but Brayden's grip held her fast.\n\n\"Brayden, you're back, aren't you? I saw your car. Why didn't you even close the door?\" Roselyn called again, her voice getting closer.\n\nThere was a brief knock on the door.\n\nTerror seized Kayley's heart. She couldn't be seen by Roselyn -- not like this.\n\nKayley grew increasingly terrified and struggled desperately, but the difference in strength was too great. She couldn't break free from under Brayden, only watching helplessly as the door handle turned.\n\nChapter 2 Toying With Her\nKayley's heart pounded in her chest.\n\nFortunately, Roselyn didn't push the door open as Kayley feared but was blocked by the locked door.\n\nIf Roselyn had barged in, Kayley didn't want to imagine the consequences.\n\n\"Brayden, are you in there? Why don't you answer?\" Roselyn's confused voice echoed through the wood.\n\nKayley was worried Brayden would continue pressing her, but his weight lifted from her.\n\n\"Coming,\" Brayden said, releasing Kayley and standing to open the door.\n\nKayley quickly found a hiding spot.\n\nAs the door opened, Roselyn peered in curiously. \"What were you doing?\"\n\nBrayden slightly turned, blocking Roselyn's view, then closed the door. \"Nothing. Why the sudden visit?\"\n\nInside, Kayley quickly got up, and listened to the siblings outside. Brayden's tone was incredibly indulgent, completely different from how he treated her.\n\nMemories flooded Kayley's mind.\n\nShe remembered her first day with the Davis family, coincidentally Roselyn's birthday.\n\nThe entire family showered her with blessings, even Kayley's own mother fawned over Roselyn, leaving Kayley alone and neglected in a corner.\n\nShe later learned Roselyn had a congenital heart condition, so the family pampered her, including the usually cold Brayden.\n\nKayley envied Roselyn for having such a gentle, caring brother. She naively believed she could become part of the Davis family -- become Brayden's sister.\n\nShe tried to win Brayden's affection, even a little. But he was always indifferent and dismissive.\n\nUntil that day...\n\n\"Aaron drove me over,\" Roselyn said, her sweet voice coming from outside. \"He's parking the car...\"\n\nThe familiar name jolted Kayley from her reverie. Her eyes widened in disbelief.\n\nCould the \"Aaron\" Roselyn mentioned be the same Aaron who had pushed her into despair?\n\nAnxiety raced through Kayley. Then, despair consumed her.\n\n\"Roselyn.\" A familiar voice shattered her hopes.\n\nIt was undeniably her ex-boyfriend, Aaron.\n\nDespite the distance, Kayley recognized his voice instantly. She would never forget it.\n\n\"You're here.\" Roselyn's voice was filled with girlish affection.\n\nKayley heard footsteps approaching.\n\n\"Are you free now, Brayden? We want to discuss our wedding date with you,\" Roselyn said. Her voice held a shy excitement.\n\n\"Yes, I love him, and he loves me. We want to get married as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Rest assured, Mr. Davis, my love for Roselyn is genuine. I'll be with her forever,\" Aaron chimed in. His tone was sincere and loving, but it chilled Kayley to the bone.\n\nThe wealthy woman Aaron had cheated with was Roselyn!\n\nNo wonder Brayden knew Aaron and wasn't surprised by his relationship with Roselyn.\n\nHad he known about Aaron's betrayal all along? So was he just toying with her earlier, making fun of her situation?\n\nAnger and humiliation surged through Kayley. Her body violently trembled.\n\nIn her panic, she stumbled, knocking over a clothes rack. It crashed to the floor with a loud bang.\n\nChapter 3 She Wants Revenge\nThe loud noise startled the trio outside the room. \"Brayden, is someone else in there?\" Roselyn asked, confused.\n\nA faint, amused smile appeared on Brayden's handsome face. \"Just left the window open. Probably a stray cat.\"\n\nRoselyn didn't believe him. \"But how could there be...\"\n\nBrayden interrupted, \"Roselyn, you should go. I'm busy today. We'll talk about your wedding later.\"\n\n\"Is it really that you're busy?\" Roselyn asked sweetly. \"Or do you not want to see me get married?\"\n\n\"Guilty as charged,\" Brayden responded warmly, but his gaze didn't linger on her at all. Instead, he turned to Aaron and said seriously as if giving an order, \"Take her home.\"\n\n\"Okay, it's indeed too late now. We're leaving,\" Aaron quickly agreed and led Roselyn away.\n\nBrayden returned to the room, in a good mood. But he found the room was empty.\n\nHe looked around and saw an earring on the windowsill. It glowed softly in the moonlight, while Brayden's expression soured.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nKayley was at her best friend Melinda Barnett's house, telling her about her day.\n\n\"And you just ran away?\" Melinda asked, frustrated. \"Why didn't you confront him? Should've slapped that b**tard!\"\n\nKayley took a sip of water. \"I didn't want Aaron and Roselyn to see me in Brayden's bedroom. So I ran without thinking.\"\n\nMelinda fumed. \"Brayden's no good either. He knew about Aaron and his sister but still played with you, not telling you the truth. Your step-siblings are a terrible pair -- one h*oks up with your man and the other laughs at your misery!\"\n\nKayley was furious too, clutching the cup tightly. After a pause, she said, \"The Davis family looks down on me, but I can't cut them off yet.\"\n\nHer eyes grew downcast. \"Only Brayden can cure my leg. I need to get close to him and ask for his help once again.\"\n\nMelinda, a longtime friend, knew how important dancing was to Kayley. She was willing to do all she could to help Kayley.\n\n\"Brayden will be entertaining clients at the Wonderland Club tomorrow afternoon. One of my clients is going there too. I can find out his room number,\" Melinda offered.\n\n\"Really?\" Kayley's eyes lit up with hope, and she gripped Melinda's hand. \"You really are amazing, a top designer with so many connections. This means a lot to me, Melinda.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it. I wish I could cure your leg myself,\" Melinda sighed, sitting beside Kayley. \"I should have studied medicine instead of fashion design. It's a useless profession.\"\n\n\"Don't say that.\" Kayley hugged her. \"When my leg is better, I'll need you to design my performance costumes.\"\n\nMelinda hugged her back. \"Should I take a day off tomorrow to go with you? It would be better to have someone with you.\"\n\n\"No need,\" Kayley declined. \"You've already helped me plenty. I don't want to drag you into this. Brayden isn't easy to deal with.\"\n\nShe truly felt that way, but she also had a different plan.\n\nShe wanted revenge.\n\nNot just on Aaron and Roselyn, but on Brayden too.\n\nIf he hated her and wanted her to suffer, she would drag him down with her...\n\nWhat happens next? \n          \nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters \n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n&5&"

In seeking revenge, she entangled him but sacrificed her heart in the bargain!\n=====\nA bolt of lightning slashed through the rainy night, Brayden Davis paused briefly, his gaze indifferent a woman huddled against a stone pillar in the courtyard before he stepped over her.\n\"Brayden, please, you're my brother,\" a familiar voice pleaded, the woman's fingers tugging at his pant leg.\nHe glanced down at her, his expression cold. \"Kayley, I've told you, Roselyn is my only sister. You don't belong here.\"\n\nKayley Spencer's heart sank, but she couldn't refute his words.\n\nShe was a burden, an unwanted stepsister. She'd lost her place within the Davis family when her mother died.\n\nBesides, Brayden had never acknowledged their familial bond.\n\n\"I'm so sorry. I just... I need help,\" she stammered, her voice trembling.\n\nBrayden didn't respond. Through a flash of lightning, he saw her pale, fragile face clearly. Despite her pitiful appearance, she still looked undeniably beautiful... just as he remembered.\n\nAs he silently gazed down at her, Kayley tentatively withdrew her hand. \"I...\"\n\nHe had made his stance clear. She would have to pick up what remained of her dignity and face this alone.\n\nWith a forced smile, she pushed herself up, ignoring the pain in her ankle. \"Sorry to bother you, Mr. Davis. I'll leave now...\"\n\nBefore she could finish, he sc**ped her up and carried her into the villa.\n\nAs he lay her down, his hands accidentally brushing against her injured ankle.\n\nKayley winced, instinctively grabbing his suit, but stifled a cry.\n\nBrayden's eyes flashed. He cruelly squeezed her ankle.\n\nShe yelped. Tears streamed down her face as she begged, \"Please stop, it hurts!\"\n\nBrayden withdrew his hand and stood up, looking down at her.\n\nKayley had thought her pitiful state might evoke his sympathy, but all she got was a mocking laugh. \"How pathetic. After leaving the Davis family, you actually ended up like this.\"\n\nKayley clearly heard the taunts in his words but chose to ignore them. She braced herself and asked for his help, choking. \"I can't dance anymore. My leg was broken. The injury healed but the nerves are still damaged. The doctor said it can't fully heal.\"\n\nTears flowed freely as she vented her shattered dreams. \"Dancing is all I have left. It's the only way I can relive memories with my mother. Please, you're the best surgeon in the country. I believe you can cure me. Please...\"\n\nBrayden remained expressionless after hearing her pleas. He then sneered and asked, \"What's that got to do with me? Go to Aaron Harding.\"\n\nKayley's eyes widened. How could Brayden possibly know about Aaron?\n\nHad he been keeping an eye on her even after she left the Davis family?\n\nConfusion filled her as she glanced at Brayden. When he offered no explanation, she awkwardly admitted, \"We broke up. Aaron cheated on me with some rich woman.\"\n\nHe was behind her injury too, but revealing that would only invite more ridicule.\n\n\"Oh.\" Brayden's enigmatic smile held no clues. \"I stopped doing surgeries three years ago to focus on the family business,\" he stated. \"You should find someone else.\"\n\nFeeling flustered, Kayley lunged forward, grasping his arm, pleading, \"Brayden, please! You're the only one who can help me. I'll do anything.\"\n\nHis gaze swept over her hand on his arm, a sneer twisting his lips. \"Trying again, like three years ago, huh?\"\n\nShe quickly pulled back, stammering an explanation. \"No, I'm just...\"\n\n\"Kayley, is that all you can do?\" he interrupted, his eyes locking onto hers. \n\nShock washed over Kayley. Did he want her to continue?\n\nBut... she thought he despised her.\n\nShe had a lot of questions but no answers. There was only one way forward if she wanted to heal her leg. She stood on her tiptoes, grabbing his clothes...\n\n\"Brayden, are you home?\" Suddenly, a voice called from outside. It was Roselyn Davis, his sister.\n\nPanic surged through Kayley as she tried to escape, but Brayden's grip held her fast.\n\n\"Brayden, you're back, aren't you? I saw your car. Why didn't you even close the door?\" Roselyn called again, her voice getting closer.\n\nThere was a brief knock on the door.\n\nTerror seized Kayley's heart. She couldn't be seen by Roselyn -- not like this.\n\nKayley grew increasingly terrified and struggled desperately, but the difference in strength was too great. She couldn't break free from under Brayden, only watching helplessly as the door handle turned.\n\nChapter 2 Toying With Her\nKayley's heart pounded in her chest.\n\nFortunately, Roselyn didn't push the door open as Kayley feared but was blocked by the locked door.\n\nIf Roselyn had barged in, Kayley didn't want to imagine the consequences.\n\n\"Brayden, are you in there? Why don't you answer?\" Roselyn's confused voice echoed through the wood.\n\nKayley was worried Brayden would continue pressing her, but his weight lifted from her.\n\n\"Coming,\" Brayden said, releasing Kayley and standing to open the door.\n\nKayley quickly found a hiding spot.\n\nAs the door opened, Roselyn peered in curiously. \"What were you doing?\"\n\nBrayden slightly turned, blocking Roselyn's view, then closed the door. \"Nothing. Why the sudden visit?\"\n\nInside, Kayley quickly got up, and listened to the siblings outside. Brayden's tone was incredibly indulgent, completely different from how he treated her.\n\nMemories flooded Kayley's mind.\n\nShe remembered her first day with the Davis family, coincidentally Roselyn's birthday.\n\nThe entire family showered her with blessings, even Kayley's own mother fawned over Roselyn, leaving Kayley alone and neglected in a corner.\n\nShe later learned Roselyn had a congenital heart condition, so the family pampered her, including the usually cold Brayden.\n\nKayley envied Roselyn for having such a gentle, caring brother. She naively believed she could become part of the Davis family -- become Brayden's sister.\n\nShe tried to win Brayden's affection, even a little. But he was always indifferent and dismissive.\n\nUntil that day...\n\n\"Aaron drove me over,\" Roselyn said, her sweet voice coming from outside. \"He's parking the car...\"\n\nThe familiar name jolted Kayley from her reverie. Her eyes widened in disbelief.\n\nCould the \"Aaron\" Roselyn mentioned be the same Aaron who had pushed her into despair?\n\nAnxiety raced through Kayley. Then, despair consumed her.\n\n\"Roselyn.\" A familiar voice shattered her hopes.\n\nIt was undeniably her ex-boyfriend, Aaron.\n\nDespite the distance, Kayley recognized his voice instantly. She would never forget it.\n\n\"You're here.\" Roselyn's voice was filled with girlish affection.\n\nKayley heard footsteps approaching.\n\n\"Are you free now, Brayden? We want to discuss our wedding date with you,\" Roselyn said. Her voice held a shy excitement.\n\n\"Yes, I love him, and he loves me. We want to get married as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Rest assured, Mr. Davis, my love for Roselyn is genuine. I'll be with her forever,\" Aaron chimed in. His tone was sincere and loving, but it chilled Kayley to the bone.\n\nThe wealthy woman Aaron had cheated with was Roselyn!\n\nNo wonder Brayden knew Aaron and wasn't surprised by his relationship with Roselyn.\n\nHad he known about Aaron's betrayal all along? So was he just toying with her earlier, making fun of her situation?\n\nAnger and humiliation surged through Kayley. Her body violently trembled.\n\nIn her panic, she stumbled, knocking over a clothes rack. It crashed to the floor with a loud bang.\n\nChapter 3 She Wants Revenge\nThe loud noise startled the trio outside the room. \"Brayden, is someone else in there?\" Roselyn asked, confused.\n\nA faint, amused smile appeared on Brayden's handsome face. \"Just left the window open. Probably a stray cat.\"\n\nRoselyn didn't believe him. \"But how could there be...\"\n\nBrayden interrupted, \"Roselyn, you should go. I'm busy today. We'll talk about your wedding later.\"\n\n\"Is it really that you're busy?\" Roselyn asked sweetly. \"Or do you not want to see me get married?\"\n\n\"Guilty as charged,\" Brayden responded warmly, but his gaze didn't linger on her at all. Instead, he turned to Aaron and said seriously as if giving an order, \"Take her home.\"\n\n\"Okay, it's indeed too late now. We're leaving,\" Aaron quickly agreed and led Roselyn away.\n\nBrayden returned to the room, in a good mood. But he found the room was empty.\n\nHe looked around and saw an earring on the windowsill. It glowed softly in the moonlight, while Brayden's expression soured.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nKayley was at her best friend Melinda Barnett's house, telling her about her day.\n\n\"And you just ran away?\" Melinda asked, frustrated. \"Why didn't you confront him? Should've slapped that b**tard!\"\n\nKayley took a sip of water. \"I didn't want Aaron and Roselyn to see me in Brayden's bedroom. So I ran without thinking.\"\n\nMelinda fumed. \"Brayden's no good either. He knew about Aaron and his sister but still played with you, not telling you the truth. Your step-siblings are a terrible pair -- one h*oks up with your man and the other laughs at your misery!\"\n\nKayley was furious too, clutching the cup tightly. After a pause, she said, \"The Davis family looks down on me, but I can't cut them off yet.\"\n\nHer eyes grew downcast. \"Only Brayden can cure my leg. I need to get close to him and ask for his help once again.\"\n\nMelinda, a longtime friend, knew how important dancing was to Kayley. She was willing to do all she could to help Kayley.\n\n\"Brayden will be entertaining clients at the Wonderland Club tomorrow afternoon. One of my clients is going there too. I can find out his room number,\" Melinda offered.\n\n\"Really?\" Kayley's eyes lit up with hope, and she gripped Melinda's hand. \"You really are amazing, a top designer with so many connections. This means a lot to me, Melinda.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it. I wish I could cure your leg myself,\" Melinda sighed, sitting beside Kayley. \"I should have studied medicine instead of fashion design. It's a useless profession.\"\n\n\"Don't say that.\" Kayley hugged her. \"When my leg is better, I'll need you to design my performance costumes.\"\n\nMelinda hugged her back. \"Should I take a day off tomorrow to go with you? It would be better to have someone with you.\"\n\n\"No need,\" Kayley declined. \"You've already helped me plenty. I don't want to drag you into this. Brayden isn't easy to deal with.\"\n\nShe truly felt that way, but she also had a different plan.\n\nShe wanted revenge.\n\nNot just on Aaron and Roselyn, but on Brayden too.\n\nIf he hated her and wanted her to suffer, she would drag him down with her...\n\nWhat happens next? \n          \nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters \n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n&5&"

In seeking revenge, she entangled him but sacrificed her heart in the bargain!\n=====\nA bolt of lightning slashed through the rainy night, Brayden Davis paused briefly, his gaze indifferent a woman huddled against a stone pillar in the courtyard before he stepped over her.\n\"Brayden, please, you're my brother,\" a familiar voice pleaded, the woman's fingers tugging at his pant leg.\nHe glanced down at her, his expression cold. \"Kayley, I've told you, Roselyn is my only sister. You don't belong here.\"\n\nKayley Spencer's heart sank, but she couldn't refute his words.\n\nShe was a burden, an unwanted stepsister. She'd lost her place within the Davis family when her mother died.\n\nBesides, Brayden had never acknowledged their familial bond.\n\n\"I'm so sorry. I just... I need help,\" she stammered, her voice trembling.\n\nBrayden didn't respond. Through a flash of lightning, he saw her pale, fragile face clearly. Despite her pitiful appearance, she still looked undeniably beautiful... just as he remembered.\n\nAs he silently gazed down at her, Kayley tentatively withdrew her hand. \"I...\"\n\nHe had made his stance clear. She would have to pick up what remained of her dignity and face this alone.\n\nWith a forced smile, she pushed herself up, ignoring the pain in her ankle. \"Sorry to bother you, Mr. Davis. I'll leave now...\"\n\nBefore she could finish, he sc**ped her up and carried her into the villa.\n\nAs he lay her down, his hands accidentally brushing against her injured ankle.\n\nKayley winced, instinctively grabbing his suit, but stifled a cry.\n\nBrayden's eyes flashed. He cruelly squeezed her ankle.\n\nShe yelped. Tears streamed down her face as she begged, \"Please stop, it hurts!\"\n\nBrayden withdrew his hand and stood up, looking down at her.\n\nKayley had thought her pitiful state might evoke his sympathy, but all she got was a mocking laugh. \"How pathetic. After leaving the Davis family, you actually ended up like this.\"\n\nKayley clearly heard the taunts in his words but chose to ignore them. She braced herself and asked for his help, choking. \"I can't dance anymore. My leg was broken. The injury healed but the nerves are still damaged. The doctor said it can't fully heal.\"\n\nTears flowed freely as she vented her shattered dreams. \"Dancing is all I have left. It's the only way I can relive memories with my mother. Please, you're the best surgeon in the country. I believe you can cure me. Please...\"\n\nBrayden remained expressionless after hearing her pleas. He then sneered and asked, \"What's that got to do with me? Go to Aaron Harding.\"\n\nKayley's eyes widened. How could Brayden possibly know about Aaron?\n\nHad he been keeping an eye on her even after she left the Davis family?\n\nConfusion filled her as she glanced at Brayden. When he offered no explanation, she awkwardly admitted, \"We broke up. Aaron cheated on me with some rich woman.\"\n\nHe was behind her injury too, but revealing that would only invite more ridicule.\n\n\"Oh.\" Brayden's enigmatic smile held no clues. \"I stopped doing surgeries three years ago to focus on the family business,\" he stated. \"You should find someone else.\"\n\nFeeling flustered, Kayley lunged forward, grasping his arm, pleading, \"Brayden, please! You're the only one who can help me. I'll do anything.\"\n\nHis gaze swept over her hand on his arm, a sneer twisting his lips. \"Trying again, like three years ago, huh?\"\n\nShe quickly pulled back, stammering an explanation. \"No, I'm just...\"\n\n\"Kayley, is that all you can do?\" he interrupted, his eyes locking onto hers. \n\nShock washed over Kayley. Did he want her to continue?\n\nBut... she thought he despised her.\n\nShe had a lot of questions but no answers. There was only one way forward if she wanted to heal her leg. She stood on her tiptoes, grabbing his clothes...\n\n\"Brayden, are you home?\" Suddenly, a voice called from outside. It was Roselyn Davis, his sister.\n\nPanic surged through Kayley as she tried to escape, but Brayden's grip held her fast.\n\n\"Brayden, you're back, aren't you? I saw your car. Why didn't you even close the door?\" Roselyn called again, her voice getting closer.\n\nThere was a brief knock on the door.\n\nTerror seized Kayley's heart. She couldn't be seen by Roselyn -- not like this.\n\nKayley grew increasingly terrified and struggled desperately, but the difference in strength was too great. She couldn't break free from under Brayden, only watching helplessly as the door handle turned.\n\nChapter 2 Toying With Her\nKayley's heart pounded in her chest.\n\nFortunately, Roselyn didn't push the door open as Kayley feared but was blocked by the locked door.\n\nIf Roselyn had barged in, Kayley didn't want to imagine the consequences.\n\n\"Brayden, are you in there? Why don't you answer?\" Roselyn's confused voice echoed through the wood.\n\nKayley was worried Brayden would continue pressing her, but his weight lifted from her.\n\n\"Coming,\" Brayden said, releasing Kayley and standing to open the door.\n\nKayley quickly found a hiding spot.\n\nAs the door opened, Roselyn peered in curiously. \"What were you doing?\"\n\nBrayden slightly turned, blocking Roselyn's view, then closed the door. \"Nothing. Why the sudden visit?\"\n\nInside, Kayley quickly got up, and listened to the siblings outside. Brayden's tone was incredibly indulgent, completely different from how he treated her.\n\nMemories flooded Kayley's mind.\n\nShe remembered her first day with the Davis family, coincidentally Roselyn's birthday.\n\nThe entire family showered her with blessings, even Kayley's own mother fawned over Roselyn, leaving Kayley alone and neglected in a corner.\n\nShe later learned Roselyn had a congenital heart condition, so the family pampered her, including the usually cold Brayden.\n\nKayley envied Roselyn for having such a gentle, caring brother. She naively believed she could become part of the Davis family -- become Brayden's sister.\n\nShe tried to win Brayden's affection, even a little. But he was always indifferent and dismissive.\n\nUntil that day...\n\n\"Aaron drove me over,\" Roselyn said, her sweet voice coming from outside. \"He's parking the car...\"\n\nThe familiar name jolted Kayley from her reverie. Her eyes widened in disbelief.\n\nCould the \"Aaron\" Roselyn mentioned be the same Aaron who had pushed her into despair?\n\nAnxiety raced through Kayley. Then, despair consumed her.\n\n\"Roselyn.\" A familiar voice shattered her hopes.\n\nIt was undeniably her ex-boyfriend, Aaron.\n\nDespite the distance, Kayley recognized his voice instantly. She would never forget it.\n\n\"You're here.\" Roselyn's voice was filled with girlish affection.\n\nKayley heard footsteps approaching.\n\n\"Are you free now, Brayden? We want to discuss our wedding date with you,\" Roselyn said. Her voice held a shy excitement.\n\n\"Yes, I love him, and he loves me. We want to get married as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Rest assured, Mr. Davis, my love for Roselyn is genuine. I'll be with her forever,\" Aaron chimed in. His tone was sincere and loving, but it chilled Kayley to the bone.\n\nThe wealthy woman Aaron had cheated with was Roselyn!\n\nNo wonder Brayden knew Aaron and wasn't surprised by his relationship with Roselyn.\n\nHad he known about Aaron's betrayal all along? So was he just toying with her earlier, making fun of her situation?\n\nAnger and humiliation surged through Kayley. Her body violently trembled.\n\nIn her panic, she stumbled, knocking over a clothes rack. It crashed to the floor with a loud bang.\n\nChapter 3 She Wants Revenge\nThe loud noise startled the trio outside the room. \"Brayden, is someone else in there?\" Roselyn asked, confused.\n\nA faint, amused smile appeared on Brayden's handsome face. \"Just left the window open. Probably a stray cat.\"\n\nRoselyn didn't believe him. \"But how could there be...\"\n\nBrayden interrupted, \"Roselyn, you should go. I'm busy today. We'll talk about your wedding later.\"\n\n\"Is it really that you're busy?\" Roselyn asked sweetly. \"Or do you not want to see me get married?\"\n\n\"Guilty as charged,\" Brayden responded warmly, but his gaze didn't linger on her at all. Instead, he turned to Aaron and said seriously as if giving an order, \"Take her home.\"\n\n\"Okay, it's indeed too late now. We're leaving,\" Aaron quickly agreed and led Roselyn away.\n\nBrayden returned to the room, in a good mood. But he found the room was empty.\n\nHe looked around and saw an earring on the windowsill. It glowed softly in the moonlight, while Brayden's expression soured.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nKayley was at her best friend Melinda Barnett's house, telling her about her day.\n\n\"And you just ran away?\" Melinda asked, frustrated. \"Why didn't you confront him? Should've slapped that b**tard!\"\n\nKayley took a sip of water. \"I didn't want Aaron and Roselyn to see me in Brayden's bedroom. So I ran without thinking.\"\n\nMelinda fumed. \"Brayden's no good either. He knew about Aaron and his sister but still played with you, not telling you the truth. Your step-siblings are a terrible pair -- one h*oks up with your man and the other laughs at your misery!\"\n\nKayley was furious too, clutching the cup tightly. After a pause, she said, \"The Davis family looks down on me, but I can't cut them off yet.\"\n\nHer eyes grew downcast. \"Only Brayden can cure my leg. I need to get close to him and ask for his help once again.\"\n\nMelinda, a longtime friend, knew how important dancing was to Kayley. She was willing to do all she could to help Kayley.\n\n\"Brayden will be entertaining clients at the Wonderland Club tomorrow afternoon. One of my clients is going there too. I can find out his room number,\" Melinda offered.\n\n\"Really?\" Kayley's eyes lit up with hope, and she gripped Melinda's hand. \"You really are amazing, a top designer with so many connections. This means a lot to me, Melinda.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it. I wish I could cure your leg myself,\" Melinda sighed, sitting beside Kayley. \"I should have studied medicine instead of fashion design. It's a useless profession.\"\n\n\"Don't say that.\" Kayley hugged her. \"When my leg is better, I'll need you to design my performance costumes.\"\n\nMelinda hugged her back. \"Should I take a day off tomorrow to go with you? It would be better to have someone with you.\"\n\n\"No need,\" Kayley declined. \"You've already helped me plenty. I don't want to drag you into this. Brayden isn't easy to deal with.\"\n\nShe truly felt that way, but she also had a different plan.\n\nShe wanted revenge.\n\nNot just on Aaron and Roselyn, but on Brayden too.\n\nIf he hated her and wanted her to suffer, she would drag him down with her...\n\nWhat happens next? \n          \nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters \n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n&5&"

In seeking revenge, she entangled him but sacrificed her heart in the bargain!\n=====\nA bolt of lightning slashed through the rainy night, Brayden Davis paused briefly, his gaze indifferent a woman huddled against a stone pillar in the courtyard before he stepped over her.\n\"Brayden, please, you're my brother,\" a familiar voice pleaded, the woman's fingers tugging at his pant leg.\nHe glanced down at her, his expression cold. \"Kayley, I've told you, Roselyn is my only sister. You don't belong here.\"\n\nKayley Spencer's heart sank, but she couldn't refute his words.\n\nShe was a burden, an unwanted stepsister. She'd lost her place within the Davis family when her mother died.\n\nBesides, Brayden had never acknowledged their familial bond.\n\n\"I'm so sorry. I just... I need help,\" she stammered, her voice trembling.\n\nBrayden didn't respond. Through a flash of lightning, he saw her pale, fragile face clearly. Despite her pitiful appearance, she still looked undeniably beautiful... just as he remembered.\n\nAs he silently gazed down at her, Kayley tentatively withdrew her hand. \"I...\"\n\nHe had made his stance clear. She would have to pick up what remained of her dignity and face this alone.\n\nWith a forced smile, she pushed herself up, ignoring the pain in her ankle. \"Sorry to bother you, Mr. Davis. I'll leave now...\"\n\nBefore she could finish, he sc**ped her up and carried her into the villa.\n\nAs he lay her down, his hands accidentally brushing against her injured ankle.\n\nKayley winced, instinctively grabbing his suit, but stifled a cry.\n\nBrayden's eyes flashed. He cruelly squeezed her ankle.\n\nShe yelped. Tears streamed down her face as she begged, \"Please stop, it hurts!\"\n\nBrayden withdrew his hand and stood up, looking down at her.\n\nKayley had thought her pitiful state might evoke his sympathy, but all she got was a mocking laugh. \"How pathetic. After leaving the Davis family, you actually ended up like this.\"\n\nKayley clearly heard the taunts in his words but chose to ignore them. She braced herself and asked for his help, choking. \"I can't dance anymore. My leg was broken. The injury healed but the nerves are still damaged. The doctor said it can't fully heal.\"\n\nTears flowed freely as she vented her shattered dreams. \"Dancing is all I have left. It's the only way I can relive memories with my mother. Please, you're the best surgeon in the country. I believe you can cure me. Please...\"\n\nBrayden remained expressionless after hearing her pleas. He then sneered and asked, \"What's that got to do with me? Go to Aaron Harding.\"\n\nKayley's eyes widened. How could Brayden possibly know about Aaron?\n\nHad he been keeping an eye on her even after she left the Davis family?\n\nConfusion filled her as she glanced at Brayden. When he offered no explanation, she awkwardly admitted, \"We broke up. Aaron cheated on me with some rich woman.\"\n\nHe was behind her injury too, but revealing that would only invite more ridicule.\n\n\"Oh.\" Brayden's enigmatic smile held no clues. \"I stopped doing surgeries three years ago to focus on the family business,\" he stated. \"You should find someone else.\"\n\nFeeling flustered, Kayley lunged forward, grasping his arm, pleading, \"Brayden, please! You're the only one who can help me. I'll do anything.\"\n\nHis gaze swept over her hand on his arm, a sneer twisting his lips. \"Trying again, like three years ago, huh?\"\n\nShe quickly pulled back, stammering an explanation. \"No, I'm just...\"\n\n\"Kayley, is that all you can do?\" he interrupted, his eyes locking onto hers. \n\nShock washed over Kayley. Did he want her to continue?\n\nBut... she thought he despised her.\n\nShe had a lot of questions but no answers. There was only one way forward if she wanted to heal her leg. She stood on her tiptoes, grabbing his clothes...\n\n\"Brayden, are you home?\" Suddenly, a voice called from outside. It was Roselyn Davis, his sister.\n\nPanic surged through Kayley as she tried to escape, but Brayden's grip held her fast.\n\n\"Brayden, you're back, aren't you? I saw your car. Why didn't you even close the door?\" Roselyn called again, her voice getting closer.\n\nThere was a brief knock on the door.\n\nTerror seized Kayley's heart. She couldn't be seen by Roselyn -- not like this.\n\nKayley grew increasingly terrified and struggled desperately, but the difference in strength was too great. She couldn't break free from under Brayden, only watching helplessly as the door handle turned.\n\nChapter 2 Toying With Her\nKayley's heart pounded in her chest.\n\nFortunately, Roselyn didn't push the door open as Kayley feared but was blocked by the locked door.\n\nIf Roselyn had barged in, Kayley didn't want to imagine the consequences.\n\n\"Brayden, are you in there? Why don't you answer?\" Roselyn's confused voice echoed through the wood.\n\nKayley was worried Brayden would continue pressing her, but his weight lifted from her.\n\n\"Coming,\" Brayden said, releasing Kayley and standing to open the door.\n\nKayley quickly found a hiding spot.\n\nAs the door opened, Roselyn peered in curiously. \"What were you doing?\"\n\nBrayden slightly turned, blocking Roselyn's view, then closed the door. \"Nothing. Why the sudden visit?\"\n\nInside, Kayley quickly got up, and listened to the siblings outside. Brayden's tone was incredibly indulgent, completely different from how he treated her.\n\nMemories flooded Kayley's mind.\n\nShe remembered her first day with the Davis family, coincidentally Roselyn's birthday.\n\nThe entire family showered her with blessings, even Kayley's own mother fawned over Roselyn, leaving Kayley alone and neglected in a corner.\n\nShe later learned Roselyn had a congenital heart condition, so the family pampered her, including the usually cold Brayden.\n\nKayley envied Roselyn for having such a gentle, caring brother. She naively believed she could become part of the Davis family -- become Brayden's sister.\n\nShe tried to win Brayden's affection, even a little. But he was always indifferent and dismissive.\n\nUntil that day...\n\n\"Aaron drove me over,\" Roselyn said, her sweet voice coming from outside. \"He's parking the car...\"\n\nThe familiar name jolted Kayley from her reverie. Her eyes widened in disbelief.\n\nCould the \"Aaron\" Roselyn mentioned be the same Aaron who had pushed her into despair?\n\nAnxiety raced through Kayley. Then, despair consumed her.\n\n\"Roselyn.\" A familiar voice shattered her hopes.\n\nIt was undeniably her ex-boyfriend, Aaron.\n\nDespite the distance, Kayley recognized his voice instantly. She would never forget it.\n\n\"You're here.\" Roselyn's voice was filled with girlish affection.\n\nKayley heard footsteps approaching.\n\n\"Are you free now, Brayden? We want to discuss our wedding date with you,\" Roselyn said. Her voice held a shy excitement.\n\n\"Yes, I love him, and he loves me. We want to get married as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Rest assured, Mr. Davis, my love for Roselyn is genuine. I'll be with her forever,\" Aaron chimed in. His tone was sincere and loving, but it chilled Kayley to the bone.\n\nThe wealthy woman Aaron had cheated with was Roselyn!\n\nNo wonder Brayden knew Aaron and wasn't surprised by his relationship with Roselyn.\n\nHad he known about Aaron's betrayal all along? So was he just toying with her earlier, making fun of her situation?\n\nAnger and humiliation surged through Kayley. Her body violently trembled.\n\nIn her panic, she stumbled, knocking over a clothes rack. It crashed to the floor with a loud bang.\n\nChapter 3 She Wants Revenge\nThe loud noise startled the trio outside the room. \"Brayden, is someone else in there?\" Roselyn asked, confused.\n\nA faint, amused smile appeared on Brayden's handsome face. \"Just left the window open. Probably a stray cat.\"\n\nRoselyn didn't believe him. \"But how could there be...\"\n\nBrayden interrupted, \"Roselyn, you should go. I'm busy today. We'll talk about your wedding later.\"\n\n\"Is it really that you're busy?\" Roselyn asked sweetly. \"Or do you not want to see me get married?\"\n\n\"Guilty as charged,\" Brayden responded warmly, but his gaze didn't linger on her at all. Instead, he turned to Aaron and said seriously as if giving an order, \"Take her home.\"\n\n\"Okay, it's indeed too late now. We're leaving,\" Aaron quickly agreed and led Roselyn away.\n\nBrayden returned to the room, in a good mood. But he found the room was empty.\n\nHe looked around and saw an earring on the windowsill. It glowed softly in the moonlight, while Brayden's expression soured.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nKayley was at her best friend Melinda Barnett's house, telling her about her day.\n\n\"And you just ran away?\" Melinda asked, frustrated. \"Why didn't you confront him? Should've slapped that b**tard!\"\n\nKayley took a sip of water. \"I didn't want Aaron and Roselyn to see me in Brayden's bedroom. So I ran without thinking.\"\n\nMelinda fumed. \"Brayden's no good either. He knew about Aaron and his sister but still played with you, not telling you the truth. Your step-siblings are a terrible pair -- one h*oks up with your man and the other laughs at your misery!\"\n\nKayley was furious too, clutching the cup tightly. After a pause, she said, \"The Davis family looks down on me, but I can't cut them off yet.\"\n\nHer eyes grew downcast. \"Only Brayden can cure my leg. I need to get close to him and ask for his help once again.\"\n\nMelinda, a longtime friend, knew how important dancing was to Kayley. She was willing to do all she could to help Kayley.\n\n\"Brayden will be entertaining clients at the Wonderland Club tomorrow afternoon. One of my clients is going there too. I can find out his room number,\" Melinda offered.\n\n\"Really?\" Kayley's eyes lit up with hope, and she gripped Melinda's hand. \"You really are amazing, a top designer with so many connections. This means a lot to me, Melinda.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it. I wish I could cure your leg myself,\" Melinda sighed, sitting beside Kayley. \"I should have studied medicine instead of fashion design. It's a useless profession.\"\n\n\"Don't say that.\" Kayley hugged her. \"When my leg is better, I'll need you to design my performance costumes.\"\n\nMelinda hugged her back. \"Should I take a day off tomorrow to go with you? It would be better to have someone with you.\"\n\n\"No need,\" Kayley declined. \"You've already helped me plenty. I don't want to drag you into this. Brayden isn't easy to deal with.\"\n\nShe truly felt that way, but she also had a different plan.\n\nShe wanted revenge.\n\nNot just on Aaron and Roselyn, but on Brayden too.\n\nIf he hated her and wanted her to suffer, she would drag him down with her...\n\nWhat happens next? \n          \nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters \n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n&5&"

Why don't you answer?\" Roselyn's confused voice echoed through the wood.\n\nKayley was worried Brayden would continue pressing her, but his weight lifted from her.\n\n\"Coming,\" Brayden said, releasing Kayley and standing to open the door.\n\nKayley quickly found a hiding spot.\n\nAs the door opened, Roselyn peered in curiously. \"What were you doing?\"\n\nBrayden slightly turned, blocking Roselyn's view, then closed the door. \"Nothing. Why the sudden visit?\"\n\nInside, Kayley quickly got up, and listened to the siblings outside. Brayden's tone was incredibly indulgent, completely different from how he treated her.\n\nMemories flooded Kayley's mind.\n\nShe remembered her first day with the Davis family, coincidentally Roselyn's birthday.\n\nThe entire family showered her with blessings, even Kayley's own mother fawned over Roselyn, leaving Kayley alone and neglected in a corner.\n\nShe later learned Roselyn had a congenital heart condition, so the family pampered her, including the usually cold Brayden.\n\nKayley envied Roselyn for having such a gentle, caring brother. She naively believed she could become part of the Davis family -- become Brayden's sister.\n\nShe tried to win Brayden's affection, even a little. But he was always indifferent and dismissive.\n\nUntil that day...\n\n\"Aaron drove me over,\" Roselyn said, her sweet voice coming from outside. \"He's parking the car...\"\n\nThe familiar name jolted Kayley from her reverie. Her eyes widened in disbelief.\n\nCould the \"Aaron\" Roselyn mentioned be the same Aaron who had pushed her into despair?\n\nAnxiety raced through Kayley. Then, despair consumed her.\n\n\"Roselyn.\" A familiar voice shattered her hopes.\n\nIt was undeniably her ex-boyfriend, Aaron.\n\nDespite the distance, Kayley recognized his voice instantly. She would never forget it.\n\n\"You're here.\" Roselyn's voice was filled with girlish affection.\n\nKayley heard footsteps approaching.\n\n\"Are you free now, Brayden? We want to discuss our wedding date with you,\" Roselyn said. Her voice held a shy excitement.\n\n\"Yes, I love him, and he loves me. We want to get married as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Rest assured, Mr. Davis, my love for Roselyn is genuine. I'll be with her forever,\" Aaron chimed in. His tone was sincere and loving, but it chilled Kayley to the bone.\n\nThe wealthy woman Aaron had cheated with was Roselyn!\n\nNo wonder Brayden knew Aaron and wasn't surprised by his relationship with Roselyn.\n\nHad he known about Aaron's betrayal all along? So was he just toying with her earlier, making fun of her situation?\n\nAnger and humiliation surged through Kayley. Her body violently trembled.\n\nIn her panic, she stumbled, knocking over a clothes rack. It crashed to the floor with a loud bang.\n\nChapter 3 She Wants Revenge\nThe loud noise startled the trio outside the room. \"Brayden, is someone else in there?\" Roselyn asked, confused.\n\nA faint, amused smile appeared on Brayden's handsome face. \"Just left the window open. Probably a stray cat.\"\n\nRoselyn didn't believe him. \"But how could there be...\"\n\nBrayden interrupted, \"Roselyn, you should go. I'm busy today. We'll talk about your wedding later.\"\n\n\"Is it really that you're busy?\" Roselyn asked sweetly. \"Or do you not want to see me get married?\"\n\n\"Guilty as charged,\" Brayden responded warmly, but his gaze didn't linger on her at all. Instead, he turned to Aaron and said seriously as if giving an order, \"Take her home.\"\n\n\"Okay, it's indeed too late now. We're leaving,\" Aaron quickly agreed and led Roselyn away.\n\nBrayden returned to the room, in a good mood. But he found the room was empty.\n\nHe looked around and saw an earring on the windowsill. It glowed softly in the moonlight, while Brayden's expression soured.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nKayley was at her best friend Melinda Barnett's house, telling her about her day.\n\n\"And you just ran away?\" Melinda asked, frustrated. \"Why didn't you confront him? Should've slapped that b**tard!\"\n\nKayley took a sip of water. \"I didn't want Aaron and Roselyn to see me in Brayden's bedroom. So I ran without thinking.\"\n\nMelinda fumed. \"Brayden's no good either. He knew about Aaron and his sister but still played with you, not telling you the truth. Your step-siblings are a terrible pair -- one h*oks up with your man and the other laughs at your misery!\"\n\nKayley was furious too, clutching the cup tightly. After a pause, she said, \"The Davis family looks down on me, but I can't cut them off yet.\"\n\nHer eyes grew downcast. \"Only Brayden can cure my leg. I need to get close to him and ask for his help once again.\"\n\nMelinda, a longtime friend, knew how important dancing was to Kayley. She was willing to do all she could to help Kayley.\n\n\"Brayden will be entertaining clients at the Wonderland Club tomorrow afternoon. One of my clients is going there too. I can find out his room number,\" Melinda offered.\n\n\"Really?\" Kayley's eyes lit up with hope, and she gripped Melinda's hand. \"You really are amazing, a top designer with so many connections. This means a lot to me, Melinda.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it. I wish I could cure your leg myself,\" Melinda sighed, sitting beside Kayley. \"I should have studied medicine instead of fashion design.

It would be better to have someone with you.\"\n\n\"No need,\" Kayley declined. \"You've already helped me plenty. I don't want to drag you into this. Brayden isn't easy to deal with.\"\n\nShe truly felt that way, but she also had a different plan.\n\nShe wanted revenge.\n\nNot just on Aaron and Roselyn, but on Brayden too.\n\nIf he hated her and wanted her to suffer, she would drag him down with her...\n\nWhat happens next? \n          \nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters \n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n&5&"

In seeking revenge, she entangled him but sacrificed her heart in the bargain!\n=====\nA bolt of lightning slashed through the rainy night, Brayden Davis paused briefly, his gaze indifferent a woman huddled against a stone pillar in the courtyard before he stepped over her.\n\"Brayden, please, you're my brother,\" a familiar voice pleaded, the woman's fingers tugging at his pant leg.\nHe glanced down at her, his expression cold. \"Kayley, I've told you, Roselyn is my only sister. You don't belong here.\"\n\nKayley Spencer's heart sank, but she couldn't refute his words.\n\nShe was a burden, an unwanted stepsister. She'd lost her place within the Davis family when her mother died.\n\nBesides, Brayden had never acknowledged their familial bond.\n\n\"I'm so sorry. I just... I need help,\" she stammered, her voice trembling.\n\nBrayden didn't respond. Through a flash of lightning, he saw her pale, fragile face clearly. Despite her pitiful appearance, she still looked undeniably beautiful... just as he remembered.\n\nAs he silently gazed down at her, Kayley tentatively withdrew her hand. \"I...\"\n\nHe had made his stance clear. She would have to pick up what remained of her dignity and face this alone.\n\nWith a forced smile, she pushed herself up, ignoring the pain in her ankle. \"Sorry to bother you, Mr. Davis. I'll leave now...\"\n\nBefore she could finish, he sc**ped her up and carried her into the villa.\n\nAs he lay her down, his hands accidentally brushing against her injured ankle.\n\nKayley winced, instinctively grabbing his suit, but stifled a cry.\n\nBrayden's eyes flashed. He cruelly squeezed her ankle.\n\nShe yelped. Tears streamed down her face as she begged, \"Please stop, it hurts!\"\n\nBrayden withdrew his hand and stood up, looking down at her.\n\nKayley had thought her pitiful state might evoke his sympathy, but all she got was a mocking laugh. \"How pathetic. After leaving the Davis family, you actually ended up like this.\"\n\nKayley clearly heard the taunts in his words but chose to ignore them. She braced herself and asked for his help, choking. \"I can't dance anymore. My leg was broken. The injury healed but the nerves are still damaged. The doctor said it can't fully heal.\"\n\nTears flowed freely as she vented her shattered dreams. \"Dancing is all I have left. It's the only way I can relive memories with my mother. Please, you're the best surgeon in the country. I believe you can cure me. Please...\"\n\nBrayden remained expressionless after hearing her pleas. He then sneered and asked, \"What's that got to do with me? Go to Aaron Harding.\"\n\nKayley's eyes widened. How could Brayden possibly know about Aaron?\n\nHad he been keeping an eye on her even after she left the Davis family?\n\nConfusion filled her as she glanced at Brayden. When he offered no explanation, she awkwardly admitted, \"We broke up. Aaron cheated on me with some rich woman.\"\n\nHe was behind her injury too, but revealing that would only invite more ridicule.\n\n\"Oh.\" Brayden's enigmatic smile held no clues. \"I stopped doing surgeries three years ago to focus on the family business,\" he stated. \"You should find someone else.\"\n\nFeeling flustered, Kayley lunged forward, grasping his arm, pleading, \"Brayden, please! You're the only one who can help me. I'll do anything.\"\n\nHis gaze swept over her hand on his arm, a sneer twisting his lips. \"Trying again, like three years ago, huh?\"\n\nShe quickly pulled back, stammering an explanation. \"No, I'm just...\"\n\n\"Kayley, is that all you can do?\" he interrupted, his eyes locking onto hers. \n\nShock washed over Kayley. Did he want her to continue?\n\nBut... she thought he despised her.\n\nShe had a lot of questions but no answers. There was only one way forward if she wanted to heal her leg. She stood on her tiptoes, grabbing his clothes...\n\n\"Brayden, are you home?\" Suddenly, a voice called from outside. It was Roselyn Davis, his sister.\n\nPanic surged through Kayley as she tried to escape, but Brayden's grip held her fast.\n\n\"Brayden, you're back, aren't you? I saw your car. Why didn't you even close the door?\" Roselyn called again, her voice getting closer.\n\nThere was a brief knock on the door.\n\nTerror seized Kayley's heart. She couldn't be seen by Roselyn -- not like this.\n\nKayley grew increasingly terrified and struggled desperately, but the difference in strength was too great. She couldn't break free from under Brayden, only watching helplessly as the door handle turned.\n\nChapter 2 Toying With Her\nKayley's heart pounded in her chest.\n\nFortunately, Roselyn didn't push the door open as Kayley feared but was blocked by the locked door.\n\nIf Roselyn had barged in, Kayley didn't want to imagine the consequences.\n\n\"Brayden, are you in there? Why don't you answer?\" Roselyn's confused voice echoed through the wood.\n\nKayley was worried Brayden would continue pressing her, but his weight lifted from her.\n\n\"Coming,\" Brayden said, releasing Kayley and standing to open the door.\n\nKayley quickly found a hiding spot.\n\nAs the door opened, Roselyn peered in curiously. \"What were you doing?\"\n\nBrayden slightly turned, blocking Roselyn's view, then closed the door. \"Nothing. Why the sudden visit?\"\n\nInside, Kayley quickly got up, and listened to the siblings outside. Brayden's tone was incredibly indulgent, completely different from how he treated her.\n\nMemories flooded Kayley's mind.\n\nShe remembered her first day with the Davis family, coincidentally Roselyn's birthday.\n\nThe entire family showered her with blessings, even Kayley's own mother fawned over Roselyn, leaving Kayley alone and neglected in a corner.\n\nShe later learned Roselyn had a congenital heart condition, so the family pampered her, including the usually cold Brayden.\n\nKayley envied Roselyn for having such a gentle, caring brother. She naively believed she could become part of the Davis family -- become Brayden's sister.\n\nShe tried to win Brayden's affection, even a little. But he was always indifferent and dismissive.\n\nUntil that day...\n\n\"Aaron drove me over,\" Roselyn said, her sweet voice coming from outside. \"He's parking the car...\"\n\nThe familiar name jolted Kayley from her reverie. Her eyes widened in disbelief.\n\nCould the \"Aaron\" Roselyn mentioned be the same Aaron who had pushed her into despair?\n\nAnxiety raced through Kayley. Then, despair consumed her.\n\n\"Roselyn.\" A familiar voice shattered her hopes.\n\nIt was undeniably her ex-boyfriend, Aaron.\n\nDespite the distance, Kayley recognized his voice instantly. She would never forget it.\n\n\"You're here.\" Roselyn's voice was filled with girlish affection.\n\nKayley heard footsteps approaching.\n\n\"Are you free now, Brayden? We want to discuss our wedding date with you,\" Roselyn said. Her voice held a shy excitement.\n\n\"Yes, I love him, and he loves me. We want to get married as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Rest assured, Mr. Davis, my love for Roselyn is genuine. I'll be with her forever,\" Aaron chimed in. His tone was sincere and loving, but it chilled Kayley to the bone.\n\nThe wealthy woman Aaron had cheated with was Roselyn!\n\nNo wonder Brayden knew Aaron and wasn't surprised by his relationship with Roselyn.\n\nHad he known about Aaron's betrayal all along? So was he just toying with her earlier, making fun of her situation?\n\nAnger and humiliation surged through Kayley. Her body violently trembled.\n\nIn her panic, she stumbled, knocking over a clothes rack. It crashed to the floor with a loud bang.\n\nChapter 3 She Wants Revenge\nThe loud noise startled the trio outside the room. \"Brayden, is someone else in there?\" Roselyn asked, confused.\n\nA faint, amused smile appeared on Brayden's handsome face. \"Just left the window open. Probably a stray cat.\"\n\nRoselyn didn't believe him. \"But how could there be...\"\n\nBrayden interrupted, \"Roselyn, you should go. I'm busy today. We'll talk about your wedding later.\"\n\n\"Is it really that you're busy?\" Roselyn asked sweetly. \"Or do you not want to see me get married?\"\n\n\"Guilty as charged,\" Brayden responded warmly, but his gaze didn't linger on her at all. Instead, he turned to Aaron and said seriously as if giving an order, \"Take her home.\"\n\n\"Okay, it's indeed too late now. We're leaving,\" Aaron quickly agreed and led Roselyn away.\n\nBrayden returned to the room, in a good mood. But he found the room was empty.\n\nHe looked around and saw an earring on the windowsill. It glowed softly in the moonlight, while Brayden's expression soured.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nKayley was at her best friend Melinda Barnett's house, telling her about her day.\n\n\"And you just ran away?\" Melinda asked, frustrated. \"Why didn't you confront him? Should've slapped that b**tard!\"\n\nKayley took a sip of water. \"I didn't want Aaron and Roselyn to see me in Brayden's bedroom. So I ran without thinking.\"\n\nMelinda fumed. \"Brayden's no good either. He knew about Aaron and his sister but still played with you, not telling you the truth. Your step-siblings are a terrible pair -- one h*oks up with your man and the other laughs at your misery!\"\n\nKayley was furious too, clutching the cup tightly. After a pause, she said, \"The Davis family looks down on me, but I can't cut them off yet.\"\n\nHer eyes grew downcast. \"Only Brayden can cure my leg. I need to get close to him and ask for his help once again.\"\n\nMelinda, a longtime friend, knew how important dancing was to Kayley. She was willing to do all she could to help Kayley.\n\n\"Brayden will be entertaining clients at the Wonderland Club tomorrow afternoon. One of my clients is going there too. I can find out his room number,\" Melinda offered.\n\n\"Really?\" Kayley's eyes lit up with hope, and she gripped Melinda's hand. \"You really are amazing, a top designer with so many connections. This means a lot to me, Melinda.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it. I wish I could cure your leg myself,\" Melinda sighed, sitting beside Kayley. \"I should have studied medicine instead of fashion design.

In seeking revenge, she entangled him but sacrificed her heart in the bargain!\n=====\nA bolt of lightning slashed through the rainy night, Brayden Davis paused briefly, his gaze indifferent a woman huddled against a stone pillar in the courtyard before he stepped over her.\n\"Brayden, please, you're my brother,\" a familiar voice pleaded, the woman's fingers tugging at his pant leg.\nHe glanced down at her, his expression cold. \"Kayley, I've told you, Roselyn is my only sister. You don't belong here.\"\n\nKayley Spencer's heart sank, but she couldn't refute his words.\n\nShe was a burden, an unwanted stepsister. She'd lost her place within the Davis family when her mother died.\n\nBesides, Brayden had never acknowledged their familial bond.\n\n\"I'm so sorry. I just... I need help,\" she stammered, her voice trembling.\n\nBrayden didn't respond. Through a flash of lightning, he saw her pale, fragile face clearly. Despite her pitiful appearance, she still looked undeniably beautiful... just as he remembered.\n\nAs he silently gazed down at her, Kayley tentatively withdrew her hand. \"I...\"\n\nHe had made his stance clear. She would have to pick up what remained of her dignity and face this alone.\n\nWith a forced smile, she pushed herself up, ignoring the pain in her ankle. \"Sorry to bother you, Mr. Davis. I'll leave now...\"\n\nBefore she could finish, he sc**ped her up and carried her into the villa.\n\nAs he lay her down, his hands accidentally brushing against her injured ankle.\n\nKayley winced, instinctively grabbing his suit, but stifled a cry.\n\nBrayden's eyes flashed. He cruelly squeezed her ankle.\n\nShe yelped. Tears streamed down her face as she begged, \"Please stop, it hurts!\"\n\nBrayden withdrew his hand and stood up, looking down at her.\n\nKayley had thought her pitiful state might evoke his sympathy, but all she got was a mocking laugh. \"How pathetic. After leaving the Davis family, you actually ended up like this.\"\n\nKayley clearly heard the taunts in his words but chose to ignore them. She braced herself and asked for his help, choking. \"I can't dance anymore. My leg was broken. The injury healed but the nerves are still damaged. The doctor said it can't fully heal.\"\n\nTears flowed freely as she vented her shattered dreams. \"Dancing is all I have left. It's the only way I can relive memories with my mother. Please, you're the best surgeon in the country. I believe you can cure me. Please...\"\n\nBrayden remained expressionless after hearing her pleas. He then sneered and asked, \"What's that got to do with me? Go to Aaron Harding.\"\n\nKayley's eyes widened. How could Brayden possibly know about Aaron?\n\nHad he been keeping an eye on her even after she left the Davis family?\n\nConfusion filled her as she glanced at Brayden. When he offered no explanation, she awkwardly admitted, \"We broke up. Aaron cheated on me with some rich woman.\"\n\nHe was behind her injury too, but revealing that would only invite more ridicule.\n\n\"Oh.\" Brayden's enigmatic smile held no clues. \"I stopped doing surgeries three years ago to focus on the family business,\" he stated. \"You should find someone else.\"\n\nFeeling flustered, Kayley lunged forward, grasping his arm, pleading, \"Brayden, please! You're the only one who can help me. I'll do anything.\"\n\nHis gaze swept over her hand on his arm, a sneer twisting his lips. \"Trying again, like three years ago, huh?\"\n\nShe quickly pulled back, stammering an explanation. \"No, I'm just...\"\n\n\"Kayley, is that all you can do?\" he interrupted, his eyes locking onto hers. \n\nShock washed over Kayley. Did he want her to continue?\n\nBut... she thought he despised her.\n\nShe had a lot of questions but no answers. There was only one way forward if she wanted to heal her leg. She stood on her tiptoes, grabbing his clothes...\n\n\"Brayden, are you home?\" Suddenly, a voice called from outside. It was Roselyn Davis, his sister.\n\nPanic surged through Kayley as she tried to escape, but Brayden's grip held her fast.\n\n\"Brayden, you're back, aren't you? I saw your car. Why didn't you even close the door?\" Roselyn called again, her voice getting closer.\n\nThere was a brief knock on the door.\n\nTerror seized Kayley's heart. She couldn't be seen by Roselyn -- not like this.\n\nKayley grew increasingly terrified and struggled desperately, but the difference in strength was too great. She couldn't break free from under Brayden, only watching helplessly as the door handle turned.\n\nChapter 2 Toying With Her\nKayley's heart pounded in her chest.\n\nFortunately, Roselyn didn't push the door open as Kayley feared but was blocked by the locked door.\n\nIf Roselyn had barged in, Kayley didn't want to imagine the consequences.\n\n\"Brayden, are you in there? Why don't you answer?\" Roselyn's confused voice echoed through the wood.\n\nKayley was worried Brayden would continue pressing her, but his weight lifted from her.\n\n\"Coming,\" Brayden said, releasing Kayley and standing to open the door.\n\nKayley quickly found a hiding spot.\n\nAs the door opened, Roselyn peered in curiously. \"What were you doing?\"\n\nBrayden slightly turned, blocking Roselyn's view, then closed the door. \"Nothing. Why the sudden visit?\"\n\nInside, Kayley quickly got up, and listened to the siblings outside. Brayden's tone was incredibly indulgent, completely different from how he treated her.\n\nMemories flooded Kayley's mind.\n\nShe remembered her first day with the Davis family, coincidentally Roselyn's birthday.\n\nThe entire family showered her with blessings, even Kayley's own mother fawned over Roselyn, leaving Kayley alone and neglected in a corner.\n\nShe later learned Roselyn had a congenital heart condition, so the family pampered her, including the usually cold Brayden.\n\nKayley envied Roselyn for having such a gentle, caring brother. She naively believed she could become part of the Davis family -- become Brayden's sister.\n\nShe tried to win Brayden's affection, even a little. But he was always indifferent and dismissive.\n\nUntil that day...\n\n\"Aaron drove me over,\" Roselyn said, her sweet voice coming from outside. \"He's parking the car...\"\n\nThe familiar name jolted Kayley from her reverie. Her eyes widened in disbelief.\n\nCould the \"Aaron\" Roselyn mentioned be the same Aaron who had pushed her into despair?\n\nAnxiety raced through Kayley. Then, despair consumed her.\n\n\"Roselyn.\" A familiar voice shattered her hopes.\n\nIt was undeniably her ex-boyfriend, Aaron.\n\nDespite the distance, Kayley recognized his voice instantly. She would never forget it.\n\n\"You're here.\" Roselyn's voice was filled with girlish affection.\n\nKayley heard footsteps approaching.\n\n\"Are you free now, Brayden? We want to discuss our wedding date with you,\" Roselyn said. Her voice held a shy excitement.\n\n\"Yes, I love him, and he loves me. We want to get married as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Rest assured, Mr. Davis, my love for Roselyn is genuine. I'll be with her forever,\" Aaron chimed in. His tone was sincere and loving, but it chilled Kayley to the bone.\n\nThe wealthy woman Aaron had cheated with was Roselyn!\n\nNo wonder Brayden knew Aaron and wasn't surprised by his relationship with Roselyn.\n\nHad he known about Aaron's betrayal all along? So was he just toying with her earlier, making fun of her situation?\n\nAnger and humiliation surged through Kayley. Her body violently trembled.\n\nIn her panic, she stumbled, knocking over a clothes rack. It crashed to the floor with a loud bang.\n\nChapter 3 She Wants Revenge\nThe loud noise startled the trio outside the room. \"Brayden, is someone else in there?\" Roselyn asked, confused.\n\nA faint, amused smile appeared on Brayden's handsome face. \"Just left the window open. Probably a stray cat.\"\n\nRoselyn didn't believe him. \"But how could there be...\"\n\nBrayden interrupted, \"Roselyn, you should go. I'm busy today. We'll talk about your wedding later.\"\n\n\"Is it really that you're busy?\" Roselyn asked sweetly. \"Or do you not want to see me get married?\"\n\n\"Guilty as charged,\" Brayden responded warmly, but his gaze didn't linger on her at all. Instead, he turned to Aaron and said seriously as if giving an order, \"Take her home.\"\n\n\"Okay, it's indeed too late now. We're leaving,\" Aaron quickly agreed and led Roselyn away.\n\nBrayden returned to the room, in a good mood. But he found the room was empty.\n\nHe looked around and saw an earring on the windowsill. It glowed softly in the moonlight, while Brayden's expression soured.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nKayley was at her best friend Melinda Barnett's house, telling her about her day.\n\n\"And you just ran away?\" Melinda asked, frustrated. \"Why didn't you confront him? Should've slapped that b**tard!\"\n\nKayley took a sip of water. \"I didn't want Aaron and Roselyn to see me in Brayden's bedroom. So I ran without thinking.\"\n\nMelinda fumed. \"Brayden's no good either. He knew about Aaron and his sister but still played with you, not telling you the truth. Your step-siblings are a terrible pair -- one h*oks up with your man and the other laughs at your misery!\"\n\nKayley was furious too, clutching the cup tightly. After a pause, she said, \"The Davis family looks down on me, but I can't cut them off yet.\"\n\nHer eyes grew downcast. \"Only Brayden can cure my leg. I need to get close to him and ask for his help once again.\"\n\nMelinda, a longtime friend, knew how important dancing was to Kayley. She was willing to do all she could to help Kayley.\n\n\"Brayden will be entertaining clients at the Wonderland Club tomorrow afternoon. One of my clients is going there too. I can find out his room number,\" Melinda offered.\n\n\"Really?\" Kayley's eyes lit up with hope, and she gripped Melinda's hand. \"You really are amazing, a top designer with so many connections. This means a lot to me, Melinda.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it. I wish I could cure your leg myself,\" Melinda sighed, sitting beside Kayley. \"I should have studied medicine instead of fashion design. It's a useless profession.\"\n\n\"Don't say that.\" Kayley hugged her. \"When my leg is better, I'll need you to design my performance costumes.\"\n\nMelinda hugged her back. \"Should I take a day off tomorrow to go with you? It would be better to have someone with you.\"\n\n\"No need,\" Kayley declined. \"You've already helped me plenty. I don't want to drag you into this. Brayden isn't easy to deal with.\"\n\nShe truly felt that way, but she also had a different plan.\n\nShe wanted revenge.\n\nNot just on Aaron and Roselyn, but on Brayden too.\n\nIf he hated her and wanted her to suffer, she would drag him down with her...\n\nWhat happens next? \n          \nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters \n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n&5&"

In seeking revenge, she entangled him but sacrificed her heart in the bargain!\n=====\nA bolt of lightning slashed through the rainy night, Brayden Davis paused briefly, his gaze indifferent a woman huddled against a stone pillar in the courtyard before he stepped over her.\n\"Brayden, please, you're my brother,\" a familiar voice pleaded, the woman's fingers tugging at his pant leg.\nHe glanced down at her, his expression cold. \"Kayley, I've told you, Roselyn is my only sister. You don't belong here.\"\n\nKayley Spencer's heart sank, but she couldn't refute his words.\n\nShe was a burden, an unwanted stepsister. She'd lost her place within the Davis family when her mother died.\n\nBesides, Brayden had never acknowledged their familial bond.\n\n\"I'm so sorry. I just... I need help,\" she stammered, her voice trembling.\n\nBrayden didn't respond. Through a flash of lightning, he saw her pale, fragile face clearly. Despite her pitiful appearance, she still looked undeniably beautiful... just as he remembered.\n\nAs he silently gazed down at her, Kayley tentatively withdrew her hand. \"I...\"\n\nHe had made his stance clear. She would have to pick up what remained of her dignity and face this alone.\n\nWith a forced smile, she pushed herself up, ignoring the pain in her ankle. \"Sorry to bother you, Mr. Davis. I'll leave now...\"\n\nBefore she could finish, he sc**ped her up and carried her into the villa.\n\nAs he lay her down, his hands accidentally brushing against her injured ankle.\n\nKayley winced, instinctively grabbing his suit, but stifled a cry.\n\nBrayden's eyes flashed. He cruelly squeezed her ankle.\n\nShe yelped. Tears streamed down her face as she begged, \"Please stop, it hurts!\"\n\nBrayden withdrew his hand and stood up, looking down at her.\n\nKayley had thought her pitiful state might evoke his sympathy, but all she got was a mocking laugh. \"How pathetic. After leaving the Davis family, you actually ended up like this.\"\n\nKayley clearly heard the taunts in his words but chose to ignore them. She braced herself and asked for his help, choking. \"I can't dance anymore. My leg was broken. The injury healed but the nerves are still damaged. The doctor said it can't fully heal.\"\n\nTears flowed freely as she vented her shattered dreams. \"Dancing is all I have left. It's the only way I can relive memories with my mother. Please, you're the best surgeon in the country. I believe you can cure me. Please...\"\n\nBrayden remained expressionless after hearing her pleas. He then sneered and asked, \"What's that got to do with me? Go to Aaron Harding.\"\n\nKayley's eyes widened. How could Brayden possibly know about Aaron?\n\nHad he been keeping an eye on her even after she left the Davis family?\n\nConfusion filled her as she glanced at Brayden. When he offered no explanation, she awkwardly admitted, \"We broke up. Aaron cheated on me with some rich woman.\"\n\nHe was behind her injury too, but revealing that would only invite more ridicule.\n\n\"Oh.\" Brayden's enigmatic smile held no clues. \"I stopped doing surgeries three years ago to focus on the family business,\" he stated. \"You should find someone else.\"\n\nFeeling flustered, Kayley lunged forward, grasping his arm, pleading, \"Brayden, please! You're the only one who can help me. I'll do anything.\"\n\nHis gaze swept over her hand on his arm, a sneer twisting his lips. \"Trying again, like three years ago, huh?\"\n\nShe quickly pulled back, stammering an explanation. \"No, I'm just...\"\n\n\"Kayley, is that all you can do?\" he interrupted, his eyes locking onto hers. \n\nShock washed over Kayley. Did he want her to continue?\n\nBut... she thought he despised her.\n\nShe had a lot of questions but no answers. There was only one way forward if she wanted to heal her leg. She stood on her tiptoes, grabbing his clothes...\n\n\"Brayden, are you home?\" Suddenly, a voice called from outside. It was Roselyn Davis, his sister.\n\nPanic surged through Kayley as she tried to escape, but Brayden's grip held her fast.\n\n\"Brayden, you're back, aren't you? I saw your car. Why didn't you even close the door?\" Roselyn called again, her voice getting closer.\n\nThere was a brief knock on the door.\n\nTerror seized Kayley's heart. She couldn't be seen by Roselyn -- not like this.\n\nKayley grew increasingly terrified and struggled desperately, but the difference in strength was too great. She couldn't break free from under Brayden, only watching helplessly as the door handle turned.\n\nChapter 2 Toying With Her\nKayley's heart pounded in her chest.\n\nFortunately, Roselyn didn't push the door open as Kayley feared but was blocked by the locked door.\n\nIf Roselyn had barged in, Kayley didn't want to imagine the consequences.\n\n\"Brayden, are you in there? Why don't you answer?\" Roselyn's confused voice echoed through the wood.\n\nKayley was worried Brayden would continue pressing her, but his weight lifted from her.\n\n\"Coming,\" Brayden said, releasing Kayley and standing to open the door.\n\nKayley quickly found a hiding spot.\n\nAs the door opened, Roselyn peered in curiously. \"What were you doing?\"\n\nBrayden slightly turned, blocking Roselyn's view, then closed the door. \"Nothing. Why the sudden visit?\"\n\nInside, Kayley quickly got up, and listened to the siblings outside. Brayden's tone was incredibly indulgent, completely different from how he treated her.\n\nMemories flooded Kayley's mind.\n\nShe remembered her first day with the Davis family, coincidentally Roselyn's birthday.\n\nThe entire family showered her with blessings, even Kayley's own mother fawned over Roselyn, leaving Kayley alone and neglected in a corner.\n\nShe later learned Roselyn had a congenital heart condition, so the family pampered her, including the usually cold Brayden.\n\nKayley envied Roselyn for having such a gentle, caring brother. She naively believed she could become part of the Davis family -- become Brayden's sister.\n\nShe tried to win Brayden's affection, even a little. But he was always indifferent and dismissive.\n\nUntil that day...\n\n\"Aaron drove me over,\" Roselyn said, her sweet voice coming from outside. \"He's parking the car...\"\n\nThe familiar name jolted Kayley from her reverie. Her eyes widened in disbelief.\n\nCould the \"Aaron\" Roselyn mentioned be the same Aaron who had pushed her into despair?\n\nAnxiety raced through Kayley. Then, despair consumed her.\n\n\"Roselyn.\" A familiar voice shattered her hopes.\n\nIt was undeniably her ex-boyfriend, Aaron.\n\nDespite the distance, Kayley recognized his voice instantly. She would never forget it.\n\n\"You're here.\" Roselyn's voice was filled with girlish affection.\n\nKayley heard footsteps approaching.\n\n\"Are you free now, Brayden? We want to discuss our wedding date with you,\" Roselyn said. Her voice held a shy excitement.\n\n\"Yes, I love him, and he loves me. We want to get married as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Rest assured, Mr. Davis, my love for Roselyn is genuine. I'll be with her forever,\" Aaron chimed in. His tone was sincere and loving, but it chilled Kayley to the bone.\n\nThe wealthy woman Aaron had cheated with was Roselyn!\n\nNo wonder Brayden knew Aaron and wasn't surprised by his relationship with Roselyn.\n\nHad he known about Aaron's betrayal all along? So was he just toying with her earlier, making fun of her situation?\n\nAnger and humiliation surged through Kayley. Her body violently trembled.\n\nIn her panic, she stumbled, knocking over a clothes rack. It crashed to the floor with a loud bang.\n\nChapter 3 She Wants Revenge\nThe loud noise startled the trio outside the room. \"Brayden, is someone else in there?\" Roselyn asked, confused.\n\nA faint, amused smile appeared on Brayden's handsome face. \"Just left the window open. Probably a stray cat.\"\n\nRoselyn didn't believe him. \"But how could there be...\"\n\nBrayden interrupted, \"Roselyn, you should go. I'm busy today. We'll talk about your wedding later.\"\n\n\"Is it really that you're busy?\" Roselyn asked sweetly. \"Or do you not want to see me get married?\"\n\n\"Guilty as charged,\" Brayden responded warmly, but his gaze didn't linger on her at all. Instead, he turned to Aaron and said seriously as if giving an order, \"Take her home.\"\n\n\"Okay, it's indeed too late now. We're leaving,\" Aaron quickly agreed and led Roselyn away.\n\nBrayden returned to the room, in a good mood. But he found the room was empty.\n\nHe looked around and saw an earring on the windowsill. It glowed softly in the moonlight, while Brayden's expression soured.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nKayley was at her best friend Melinda Barnett's house, telling her about her day.\n\n\"And you just ran away?\" Melinda asked, frustrated. \"Why didn't you confront him? Should've slapped that b**tard!\"\n\nKayley took a sip of water. \"I didn't want Aaron and Roselyn to see me in Brayden's bedroom. So I ran without thinking.\"\n\nMelinda fumed. \"Brayden's no good either. He knew about Aaron and his sister but still played with you, not telling you the truth. Your step-siblings are a terrible pair -- one h*oks up with your man and the other laughs at your misery!\"\n\nKayley was furious too, clutching the cup tightly. After a pause, she said, \"The Davis family looks down on me, but I can't cut them off yet.\"\n\nHer eyes grew downcast. \"Only Brayden can cure my leg. I need to get close to him and ask for his help once again.\"\n\nMelinda, a longtime friend, knew how important dancing was to Kayley. She was willing to do all she could to help Kayley.\n\n\"Brayden will be entertaining clients at the Wonderland Club tomorrow afternoon. One of my clients is going there too. I can find out his room number,\" Melinda offered.\n\n\"Really?\" Kayley's eyes lit up with hope, and she gripped Melinda's hand. \"You really are amazing, a top designer with so many connections. This means a lot to me, Melinda.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it. I wish I could cure your leg myself,\" Melinda sighed, sitting beside Kayley. \"I should have studied medicine instead of fashion design. It's a useless profession.\"\n\n\"Don't say that.\" Kayley hugged her. \"When my leg is better, I'll need you to design my performance costumes.\"\n\nMelinda hugged her back. \"Should I take a day off tomorrow to go with you? It would be better to have someone with you.\"\n\n\"No need,\" Kayley declined. \"You've already helped me plenty. I don't want to drag you into this. Brayden isn't easy to deal with.\"\n\nShe truly felt that way, but she also had a different plan.\n\nShe wanted revenge.\n\nNot just on Aaron and Roselyn, but on Brayden too.\n\nIf he hated her and wanted her to suffer, she would drag him down with her...\n\nWhat happens next? \n          \nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters \n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n&5&"
