                      "text": "Chapter 0001\nIt was ten o'clock in the evening. Sydney Castro sat in front of the dressing table, rubbing essential oils on her body for that glowing skin.\n\nClearly, she was getting ready to please a man.\n\nHer husband, whom she had not seen for two years, was returning to Somerland today. She missed him terribly.\n\nSydney oiled every part of her body until she was soft and smooth. Then she put on a white, furry lingerie set with a cheeky little cat tail on the small of her back.\n\nIn truth, she did not have to go to such trouble in the past. Lorenzo had wished he could stick to her every day, but after that fateful day, everything changed.\n\nShe went from being his closest lover to the woman he hated the most.\n\nLater, their elders arranged for them to get married. However, Lorenzo was so reluctant that he left the country the day after signing their marriage certificate.\n\nNow two years have passed, during which he only contacted her once. It was six months after her mother's death that he sent her a divorce agreement.\n\nSydney did not sign the papers. She still harbored thoughts of rekindling her marriage with Lorenzo.\n\nHowever, it was difficult.\n\nShe was not even aware he was returning tonight. She only found out when she saw Lorenzo\u2019s friends posted about their drinking session on social media.\n\nLater, she called her mother-in-law, who helped her and sent a driver to bring Lorenzo back.\n\nThe driver called. Lorenzo would be home in a few minutes.\n\nShe had to seize this opportunity and try to rekindle their old flame again.\n\nIntentionally dressed up, she knelt on fours by the bed, evenly distributing the rose petals that had been sprinkled on the bed in advance. She was so engrossed that she did not notice a long shadow walking in.\n\nSuddenly, Sydney\u2019s cat tail was yanked hard as a hot-blooded torso pressed on her back. Her heart skipped a beat. She turned back and came face-to-face with a deep yet intense set of piercing eyes.\n\n\"Enzo...\" she began delicately, \"You finally came...\" Back.\n\nThe rest of her sentence was choked back by a kiss reeking of ethanol.\n\nSydney's eyelashes fluttered as her body responded to his. She was not sure whether Lorenzo was drunk or if her outfit tonight was a success. \n\nLorenzo kissed her so passionately that he wanted to suck her lips swollen. He placed his hands over her waist , grabbing them vigorously.\n\nThe man seemed satisfied. While taking a breath, he growled in a whisper. \"good...\"\n\nGrowling in a whisper was considered flirting. That was Lorenzo\u2019s special habit. \n\nRecently, she had been doing yoga. Her figure was way better than two years ago. This was also a surprise for Lorenzo. His words and actions ignited the fire in her heart.\n\nHer plump waist rose and fell violently. Her rapid breath escaped her rosy lips. Her glowy, fair hands explored his waist through his custom silk shirt, caressing his hard and steamy muscles for the first time in a long time. She hurriedly unbuttoned his shirt.\n\nThe smooth material slid down his strong arms. She unbuckled his belt and wrapped her legs around his waist.\n\nEight years of familiarity with each other made them very compatible in bed. No need for any fluff, they went straight into it.\n\nPerhaps it was because they had not seen each other for too long. His desire seemed to be even more intense than hers, just like when he first tasted the forbidden fruit eight years ago. The man was excited and tireless.\n\nThis went on for more than three hours. Finally, he was satisfied.\n\nSydney laid on the man's beautiful sculpted chest and kissed his handsome face obsessively, trying to make up for lost time.\n\nLorenzo kept his eyes closed, allowing her kisses.\n\n \"I'm very pleased with you tonight.\"Lorenzo said\n\nSydney smiled and kissed the corner of his lips again.\n\nLorenzo raised the corners of his lips. He grabbed her waist hard, and turned over to hold her down.\n\nSydney was sure that he was in a good mood now.\n\nShe stretched out her hand to rub his Adam's apple. Right before they did it again, she said bluntly, \"Enzo, four years ago\u2026I swear nothing happened between Oliver and I. My body and soul completely belong to you. You are finally back. Can we please forget what happened that day and move forward together?\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the smile on the man's face froze instantly.\n\nLorenzo raised his hand and grabbed Sydney\u2019s throat. \n\nSydney's heart skipped a beat. She widened her eyes in panic. It was over. She had said the wrong thing.\n\nThis happened twice before. If she mentioned the words \"four years ago\", Lorenzo would immediately become ruthless and sinister.\n\nHer best friend once said that Lorenzo's reaction was akin to PTSD, a post-traumatic stress reaction.\n\nShe had doubts at the time, and it turned out to be the same today, which proved that her best friend was right.\n\nIn a daze, she heard Lorenzo say, \"Move forward with me? You?\n\n\"I touched you tonight because I'm afraid that you,  wouldn\u2019t change your disgusting habit and sleep with my friends again!\"\n\n\"I won't, I didn\u2019t...\" Sydney explained and reached out to touch his hand, attempting to soothe him.\n\nLorenzo's hand tightened, \"Don't touch me!\"\n\nSydney's face was red from Lorenzo\u2019s grip on her throat.\n\nLorenzo took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. \"You'd better sign the divorce agreement as soon as possible. The past love we had will never be rekindled.\"\n\n The words \u2018divorce agreement\u2019 stabbed Sydney\u2019s heart like a sword. She looked up anxiously, and said with difficulty, \"We were so good back then. Are you going to completely deny all that I\u2019ve done for you, just because of that incident?\n\n\"Oliver and I both explained back then that nothing happened to us. We were set up!\"\n\nHowever, the more she explained, the angrier Lorenzo became. His hand went up her neck and grabbed her chin. The force in his grip became stronger and stronger. Sydney could feel that he wanted to crush her chin.\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\nHe ignored her cries of pain.\n\n\"Set up? Lying on the same bed with him might be a set up, but what about the child in your belly?\"\n\n\"Sydney, I wanted so badly for that baby to be mine at that time... But all the hospitals we went to in Quill City showed the same result: You were fifteen days conceived a baby.!\n\n\"I was on a business trip for two months and you were fifteen days conceived a baby. How could you make me believe that nothing happened between you and him?!\"\n\nAfter that, Lorenzo shook her off.\n\nSydney fell on the pillow. She straightened her messy hair, stood up again and explained shakily, \"But the first doctor I consulted was a traditional medicine practitioner. The old doctor said that I was two months conceived a baby. I didn't tell you immediately because I wanted to wait for you to come back to give you a surprise!\n\n\"You\u2019ve met that old doctor too. He showed you the prescription he gave me with the time written on it. Why won't you...\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Lorenzo interrupted her, \"Handwritten time has no credibility, and it's easier to bribe an old traditional medicine practitioner. Stop now and shut up!\"\n\nShe stood in his shoes and could understand the hurt in his heart. However, she still felt heartbroken from how he decisively shunned her.\n\nEspecially their child. The rejection was heartbreakingly painful.\n\nShe knew it was useless to say anything, so she kept quiet and shed tears of frustration.\n\nLorenzo got out of bed and made a phone call.\n\nThe room was quiet. As the call connected, Sydney heard the voice on the other end. She quickly got out of bed.\n\nA woman\u2019s voice. \"Mr. Bailey\u2026\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"Are you still here?\"\n\nWoman, \"Yes, do you want to come over?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lorenzo said and hung up the phone. \n\nSydney held him back. Her eyes widened with tears and her voice trembled. \"Are you seeing someone else?\"\n\nChapter 0002\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\nSydney\u2019s world collapsed as she burst into tears. \"When did it happen?! Who is she?!\"\n\nShe looked utterly miserable now. Lorenzo had no mercy, he might have even felt a little pleasure seeing her in pain.\n\n\"Can\u2019t stand seeing me with someone else?\"\n\nYes, she could not stand it.\n\nLoving a person would inherently make one possessive. Lorenzo meant so much to her that she could not accept losing him.\n\nAt this moment, the way she was just speechlessly hyperventilating due to the blow was more pathetic than crying. It felt like she was falling to pieces.\n\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He got dressed and left the bedroom.\n\nSydney refused to give up and chased after him. \"Why won\u2019t you believe that I was set up?\"\n\nLorenzo stopped and turned around. \"Then tell me, who set you up?\"\n\nThe corridor of the mansion was wide and long. Sydney was speechless as she looked at the lanky man in white shirt and trousers.    \n\nFour years ago, they talked about this many times. Each time they got stuck here.\n\nExactly.\n\nShe still did not find out who did it.\n\nThe setup was extremely vicious.\n\nLorenzo and Sydney\u2019s relationship turned from true love to pure hatred. They were so miserable for each other that it broke apart Lorenzo and Oliver\u2019s friendship. It also caused Sydney to become mentally ill, miscarrying from extreme heartache...\n\nHowever, she still could not identify the mastermind behind this! Four years ago, Sydney and Oliver searched for a long time but to no avail.\n\nLorenzo left.\n\nSydney stood in the corridor for a long time. She clutched her chest and raced towards the room at the corner of the corridor, calling out with each step, \"Mrs. Harper...\"\n\nHer breath became shorter each time.\n\nWhen she reached the door, she reached out and knocked, then her vision went dark as she fell to the ground unconscious.\n\nThe door opened shortly. The nanny had the shock of her life and quickly picked Sydney up in panic. \"Madam!\"\n\nThe sound of a car driving away was heard downstairs.\n\nSydney regained consciousness after Mrs. Harper gave her first aid.\n\nMrs. Harper had a glass of water and a handful of white pills in her hand. She said, \"Madam, why don't you tell your husband about your condition? If he sympathizes with you because of this, you might...\"\n\nSydney shook her head stubbornly, \"He and I are together because we love each other. I don't want to be pitied.\"\n\nShe took the pills and swallowed them. She closed her eyes and kept silent for a long time, then she said to Mrs. Harper, \"He\u2019s seeing someone else. I want to know who she is. Tell me, is it okay for me to ask his friends?\"\n\n\u2026\n\nMelon, the largest nightclub in Quill City.\n\nMusic was blaring in a VIP room. Lorenzo kicked the door open and went in. The men who were dancing intimately with the women almost soiled their pants.\n\nHowever, no one dared to be angry.\n\nLorenzo was a peculiar legend in Quill City. In his youth, he was an uncivilized and rebellious devil. Despite being a member of the Bailey Group, the wealthiest corporation in Quill City, he was cast out as the black sheep of the family and was dead broke.\n\nLater, his parents could not stand it anymore and made a plan for him to study abroad. He refused without hesitation. Instead, he relied on the prize money he got from a gaming tournament and simply enrolled himself in a vocational school.\n\nSuch a self-destructive person suddenly changed at the age of twenty.\n\nLorenzo became extremely hard-working. He diligently went to class and hung out in the library. He would also dress up and leave the dormitory at around six o'clock every morning. He rode the bicycle for an hour to Quill City Fine Arts Academy for lectures.\n\nSome people claimed that he had fallen in love with a student from Quill City Fine Arts Academy.\n\nNot long after, he wanted to start a company. His family was not supportive, of course. So, he put a knife to Grandpa Bailey\u2019s throat and grabbed 300 million to open a jewelry company, registered as Cherr.y.\n\nAt that time, the Baileys thought that the 300 million was burned for good. However, Cherr.y turned out to be unexpectedly successful. It made ten times the profit in its second year. In the fourth year, it was listed in Newford.\n\nToday, the \u2018Black Sheep\u2019 was a self-made man and had become the heir to the Bailey Group. Cherr.y had become a world-renowned jewelry brand.\n\nAs soon as Lorenzo sat down on the sofa, a group of beauties quickly came over and said, \"Mr. Bailey!\"\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nThe women trembled in fright and scurried away. Two more men sat down and said, \"Lorenzo, what pissed you off at home?\"\n\nLorenzo kept quiet. He picked up a glass and started chugging.\n\nThe others did not say anything anymore. They picked up their glass to drink with him.\n\nNot a moment later, someone's cell phone rang on the table.\n\n\"Xavier, your phone!\"\n\nA handsome man with platinum blond hair sat up on the sofa in a dark hidden corner.\n\nXavier woke up from his nap and scratched his tattooed neck. He took a look at his cell phone and his eyes widened.\n\n\"Lorenzo,\" he looked at Lorenzo, \"Why is Sydney calling me?\"\n\nLorenzo paused mid-drink and looked at Xavier. \"Who?\"\n\nXavier walked up to him with his cell phone, \"Your wife!\"\n\nLorenzo's expression turned sinister. \"When did you get her number?\"\n\nXavier said casually, \"On the day you both got married, I gave her my number when we sang together in the karaoke bar.\"\n\nHearing that, Lorenzo stood up abruptly and grabbed Xavier's collar, \"Who asked you to give your number?\"\n\nXavier frowned, puzzled at his friend\u2019s sudden rage. He pushed Lorenzo's hand away, \"We were all having fun, what\u2019s the big deal in exchanging contact information?\"\n\nLorenzo got angry. \"WHY\"\n\nWith that, he punched the undefended Xavier.\n\nXavier was caught off guard and slammed onto the marble table. The wine and glasses on the table clattered onto the floor.\n\nThe atmosphere froze. Lorenzo's eyes turned red like a furious beast. He growled, \"Delete her number!\"\n\nXavier was no sitting duck either. He was the second generation of the Altmans, an old money family in Quill City.  He was the prodigal son of the Altmans, a notorious troublemaker. He could hang out frequently with Lorenzo because they were similar.\n\nXavier wiped the bleeding corner of his lips and punched Lorenzo in return. \"What's going on, Popeye? Use your words, not your fists!\"\n\nLorenzo was hit on the head. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then he grabbed Xavier, pressed him on the sofa and beat him in a frenzy. \"How many times have you contacted Sydney in the past two years?!!\"\n\nXavier dodged Lorenzo's heavy punches and said, \"Why would I contact your wife like I have nothing else to do?! Have you gone mad? I'll admit you to the mental hospital!\"\n\nThese words seemed to hit a nerve. Lorenzo paused. \n\nHe was stunned for a few seconds. Then, he sat down on the side and then closed his eyes to quell the anger in his heart.\n\nXavier sat up, frowned and rubbed his shoulders. Vulgarities spewed.\n\nLorenzo ignored Xavier. After a while, he calmed down. He opened his eagle eyes and scanned the other men in the room, \"Who else saved her number?\"\n\nImmediately, several men lowered their heads to look for their phones.\n\nLorenzo was startled.\n\nImmediately, terrifying sounds of broken bottles filled the space, as well as Lorenzo's angry swear words, and screams of women as they dodge shards of glass.\n\nLorenzo seemed to have lost his mind and started attacking all his friends.\n\nXavier stepped outside with his cell phone and returned Sydney\u2019s call.\n\nWhen Sydney picked up, Xavier humbly said, \"Hi, Sydney. What's the matter?\"\n\nSydney's voice was gentle and polite. \"Xavier, I'm sorry to bother you. Lorenzo got a little upset with me tonight. He blocked me and I can't contact him. I wanted to ask if you know where he is.\"\n\nChapter 0003\n\"He was drinking with me, and now he's drunk and acting crazy. I'll send him back to you later. Don\u2019t worry.\"\n\nSydney paused for a moment then said, \"Can you give me the address? I want to check on him myself.\"\n\nXavier took a deep breath, opened the door and saw the chaos inside. He said, \"Melon, A.\"\n\nAbout ten minutes later, apart from Lorenzo and Xavier, everyone else left.\n\nLorenzo sat on the sofa. He stared at the chandelier on the ceiling, lost in thoughts.\n\nXavier sat next to him, \"We are not a part of your drama with Sydney. If anything, go home and solve it with her. Don't go crazy here.\"\n\nLorenzo closed his eyes. \"I\u2019m not going home.\"\n\n\"You must,\" \"Then tell me what happened between you two, I\u2019ll find a way for you.\"\n\nLorenzo, \"You can't.\"\n\n\u201cFine,\" Xavier said, \"If you won't go home, where will you go later?\"\n\n\"Chelsea will pick me up.\"\n\nXavier was stunned for a moment. \"Are you okay? You got so anxious when your wife called me. And now you\u2019re going to see another woman?\n\n\"I met you late. I don't know what happened between you and Sydney. You left her alone for two years, acting like you really don't care. However, we are not allowed to keep her contact information. What on earth are you thinking?\"\n\nLorenzo became impatient again. \"Boy, don\u2019t meddle with adult matters.\"\n\nWhen Xavier started to curse, a creaking sound came from the door. The two of them looked towards the door.\n\n\u201cEnzo,\u201d A sweet voice came.\n\nThe woman had the body of a devil and the face of an angel as she slithered in. She was the \u2018Nation\u2019s Goddess\u2019 and top tier actress, Chelsea Dune.\n \nLorenzo's expression finally softened a little when she appeared. \"Here she comes.\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows subtly.\n\nChelsea elegantly sat next to Lorenzo while avoiding the mess on the ground. She saw the cut at the corner of his eye.\n\nThe woman frowned. \"Why are you hurt?\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"It's nothing. I just drank too much.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt?\" As she spoke, Chelsea reached out and took Lorenzo's arm.\n\nXavier said with a smile, \"Hey Superstar, do you know he is married?\"\n\nChelsea paused and retracted her hand in embarrassment. \"Enzo and I are just friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, cool.\"\n\nLorenzo seemed displeased with Xavier's sarcasm towards Chelsea. He retorted, \"What are you trying to say?\"\n\nXavier stuck his tongue in his cheek and stood up with a grin. \"Nothing. Things among you guys are too complicated for my little brain. I\u2019m gonna go home to bed.\"\n\nAs soon as Xavier reached the door, the door was opened from the outside.\n\nXavier paused.\n\nSydney stood timidly at the door.\n\nShe was timid but she was objectively eye-catching.\n\nHer long, dark and wavy hair draped casually down her back. She had light makeup on her delicate and pretty face. Her lips were as bright as cherry, with a hint of sparkle.\n\nThe velvet, burgundy strappy dress contrasted with her flawless, snow-white skin. She was like a blooming red rose in the dark night.\n\nXavier gulped. He forgot how to speak at that moment.\n\nLorenzo's voice was suddenly heard. \"Who\u2019s there?\"\n\nXavier was stunned,and stepped aside to make way for Sydney. After Sydney entered the room, he exhaled and came back to his senses.\n\nAs soon as Sydney reached the door, she froze.\n\nEveryone had left. The private room had the brightest lights turned on. Right in the middle, Lorenzo and Chelsea were sitting together with their arms touching each other. To Sydney, that scene hurt her eyes more than the light.\n\nHer breath was stuck in her throat. Her lips quivered, but she could not say a word.\n\nLorenzo had an affair with Chelsea, her college bully!\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Lorenzo frowned, \"Go back!\"\n\nSydney shuddered then finally took a step. She quickened her pace.\n\nShe went up to the two of them. While everyone was caught off guard, she slapped Chelsea across the face and grabbed her hair. \"It's you!\"\n\nChelsea screamed, \"Ah! Enzo, help me!\"\n\n\u201cSydney!\u201d\n\nWhen Lorenzo spoke, Sydney let go of Chelsea. She raised her hand towards Lorenzo, but did not strike him.\n\nHer hands trembled. She broke down and shouted, \"You clearly know what she did to me back then! Of all the people, why her?!\"\n\nSuddenly.\n\nSlap!\n\nChelsea took advantage when Sydney was unguarded and slapped her back. That slap was even harder than Sydney\u2019s.\n\nSydney felt ringing in her ears, and then blood dripped from the corners of her lips.\n\nChelsea snarled, \"Why blame others if you can't keep your man?!\"\n\nSydney held her face. Her eyes turned red at Chelsea\u2019s smug expression. She shouted, \"I'm taking your life. \n\nShe tried to attack Chelsea again, but Lorenzo stopped her. He grabbed the back of her head and threw her to the other side of the sofa.\n\n\"I told you to go back, are you deaf?\"\n\nSydney felt as if she had gone deaf. The ringing in her ears was so severe that she couldn't hear what Lorenzo said. Half of her head was throbbing.\n\nAt this moment, Chelsea suddenly covered her ears and wailed, \"Enzo, I can't hear!\"\n\nLorenzo was shocked, \"You can\u2019t hear?\"\n\nChelsea's eyes widened in pity, and her cries became louder. \"I can't hear what you said...\"\n\nLorenzo looked back and glared at Sydney fiercely. He stood up, arms over Chelsea and walked out, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier, saw Lorenzo escorting a tearful Chelsea out of the room. He knew something was amiss and quickly entered the room.\n\nSydney closed her eyes and clasped her head with her hands. She fell sideways on the sofa. Her shoulders shook.\n\nAt the moment, half of that bright and charming face was as pale as paper, and the other half was marked with an angry palm print. The blood on the corners of her lips stood out even more.\n\nXavier's eyes widened and he rushed over. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney did not respond.\n\nXavier nudged her gently. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney then opened her eyes, her voice fading away, \"My, my ears hurt...\"\n\nWith the slap mark and her ear hurting, Xavier immediately understood what had happened. He helped Sydney up and said, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\nSydney only managed to take two steps before her legs gave way. She was about to crash.\n\nPeople lose strength when they cannot bear the pain. Sydney would rather die than have Lorenzo cheated on her with Chelsea.\n\nXavier felt a pang of distress. He carried Sydney in his arms and hurried out.\n\n\u2026\n\nLorenzo and Chelsea stopped outside the main entrance of Melon. He said, \"Wait for me here, I'll get the car.\"\n\nChelsea held him and said, \"Enzo, I'm better now. I don\u2019t think I need to go to the hospital. Come with me and stay with me, okay?\"\n\nLorenzo frowned, and just as he was about to agree, something behind Chelsea attracted his attention.\n\nXavier carried Sydney and walked quickly towards the parking lot.\n\nLorenzo frowned, \"Since you don't need to go to the hospital, you should go back to the hotel first.\"\n\nWith that, he turned to chase after Xavier, but Chelsea pulled him back. \"Are you going to look for Sydney? How could she treat you like that but you still can't let her go?\"\n\nChapter 0004\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He did not answer and strode after Xavier.\n\nChelsea exhaled forcefully. Her shoulders trembled. She looked at Sydney and Xavier with clear hatred and jealousy.\n\nHowever, Lorenzo did not manage to intercept Xavier. When he passed by, Xavier's car drifted gorgeously before merging onto the main freeway.\n\n\u2026\n\nInside the car.\n\nSydney crumpled into a ball and leaned against the car window. Xavier fastened the seat belt for her.\n\nTears streamed down her face the whole time, but she was expressionless, like a soulless sculpture.\n\nThe pain in her ear strained the nerves across her head, and pulled out many memories that she did not want to recall.\n\nA group of heavily made-up girls surrounded her. The proudest one leading the pack, was Chelsea, the one with the harmless face.\n\nHer smile was pure evil. She pulled Sydney\u2019s hair, and let her companions take turns to slap her. Chelsea dripped melted white ice cream on Sydney\u2019s face and chest.\n\nSydney dared not resist because her grandmother, Mary Collins, was in the hands of Christopher, Chelsea's father.\n\nThe Dunes were quite wealthy. Christopher owned a ceramics company, and Mary used to work as a cleaner in Christopher\u2019s office building.\n\nMary had always done a good job, but that day Chelsea insisted that Mary accidentally destroyed her father's documents. Even a fool knew that it was all a farce.\n\nSydney was a freshman that year and Chelsea was a sophomore.\n\nAt the Quill City Fine Arts Academy, Chelsea had always been the most sought-after goddess by many in the school. After Sydney entered the school, she stole Chelsea\u2019s glory.\n\nJealousy was written all over Chelsea's innocent face.\n\nChelsea took those humiliating photos and made Sydney look cheap. Soon, other people's harsh words tormented her as well.\n\nSydney, you are so pretty. If You planned turns a resentful woman,would your grandma still need to be a cleaner in her old age to support the family?\n\n\"Sydney! Hey, Sydney!\"\n\nXavier's words pulled her back from her thoughts.\n\nShe turned her head blankly to be met with a pair of gentle, concerned eyes.\n\nXavier saw her motionless and thought she had died with her eyes wide open.\n\nThe speed of the car was fast, and the pressure on her back felt comfortable. Sydney took the pills earlier and felt better because her discomfort was suppressed. Her ears still hurt but she could hear clearly.\n\n\"Xavier, thank you.\"\n\nXavier breathed out, \"As long as you're fine.\"\n\nSydney continued to be silent.\n\nIt was already four o'clock in the middle of the night. There were very few cars on the road.\n\nAfter Xavier turned a corner, he looked back at her.\n\nHis Adam's apple rolled quietly once more.\n\nSydney looked bright and charming from the front, but she looked even more striking with her smooth facial outline and high nose from the side. Her thick eyelashes were naturally curled; It felt like she was God\u2019s favorite.\n\nSydney stood out even among beauties and was considered stunning. She was spotted by a talent scout when she hit puberty in her first year of high school.\n\nHowever, her mother refused to allow her to enter the entertainment industry, so she had been keeping her head down at school. Initially, her mother had strict requirements. Sydney was not allowed to have long hair or wear nice clothes.\n\nThroughout high school, she had ugly short hair and wore puffy, outdated and tacky clothes. She was bullied when she started dressing up in college. It was not until she fell in love with that Black Sheep Enzo that she began to step out of her shell because she had someone to protect her.\n\nXavier broke the silence in the car again. \"You knew that all the boys have only known Lorenzo in the past three or four years. Am I right to say that you and Lorenzo have known each other for a long time?\"\n\nWith that, Sydney said, \"Yeah, he was my first love. I dated him when I was a freshman. He stayed with me throughout my college days for four years. We broke up when I graduated...\"\n\n\"After two years of separation, the elders in our respective families crossed paths by accident, and they arranged for us to get married for some reason. I was willing to get married, but he was not.\"\n\nXavier frowned. \"Do you...love him very much?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Sydney\u2019s voice trembled again, \"He used to be... very good to me. Extremely good.\"\n\nShe was deeply caught up by their love, whereby a simple sentence could dig up those heavy and profound memories.\n\n\"I don't have a father. Lorenzo not only gave me the sense of security that a boyfriend should, but he was protective like a father.\n\n\"For every holiday, others are picked up by their parents, but Lorenzo picked me up. At every start of the school season, parents would send their kids to class, but Lorenzo would send me. The day before school started, he would help me check my luggage. He would make sure I had everything I needed. He would also secretly put money into the pockets of my clothes.\u201d\n\nSydney's tears rolled down her cheeks again as she recalled those memories.\n\nXavier tightened his grip on the steering wheel. His expression became heavy. He did not expect Lorenzo to have such a tender and considerate side.\n\nHowever, tenderness and consideration were the most fearful things in a relationship because trying to move on after a breakup was tantamount to chipping away at the bones.\n\nAfter a moment, Xavier spoke, \"You are now... relying on his past kindness to you to support your marriage.\"\n\nThis sentence summed up her lonely married life for the past two years. Sydney lifted her hand and wiped her eyes, \"I am not willing to lose him. We were so good together; I really can't accept the current situation...\"\n   \n\nXavier said, \"But Sydney, have you ever thought about it? Many couples who have been estranged were once deeply in love in the past. You\u2019ve been tormenting yourself by living in the past. You will definitely meet a man who treats you better in the future.\"\n\nSydney sobbed, \"I tried moving on, but I still can't get over...\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows and changed his approach. \"Chelsea hit you, but he took Chelsea away without concern for you. Can you bear it?\"\n\nSydney was stunned for a moment. The hidden deep affection in her eyes was immediately replaced by hatred as her emotions flared up.\n\n\"No, I told Lorenzo from the start that anyone who is friends with Chelsea is my enemy. Did Lorenzo really have feelings for Chelsea, or did he do it deliberately to spite me...\n\n\"No, I can't think like that either,\" she began to mumble through her chaotic thoughts, \"No matter what his purpose is, if he really slept with Chelsea...\"\n\nShe did not continue, but closed her eyes and began to take deep breaths.\n\nSome scenes were just fantasies, but enough to suffocate her.\n\nXavier's heart ached a little when he saw Sydney in pain. At the same time, he was also curious about what happened between Sydney and Chelsea.\n\nJust as he was about to ask, his cell phone, which he had thrown inside the armrest storage, rang.\n\nHe looked down. It was a call from Lorenzo.\n\nXavier frowned, turned over his phone and clicked to hang up. He glanced in the rearview mirror again.\n\nBehind him was a flashy, black and red car, the world\u2019s rarest supercar. A toy owned by the richest man in Quill City.\n\nXavier looked at Sydney again. Her sobs could really melt a man's heart. He secretly gripped the steering wheel.\n\nIt was not Sydney who gave him her number first. The men, including him, noticed Lorenzo's indifference towards her, but were too captivated by her beauty, so they asked for it behind Lorenzo's back.\n\nOf course, they all found a perfect reason. They asked Sydney to leave her number, so they could contact her for business purposes.\n\nAt that time, no one dared to have filthy intentions. She was Lorenzo's legal wife, and Lorenzo was one of the most outstanding people among his friends.\n\nAside from the fact that Sydney was married, she was indeed a rare beauty. Everyone thought it was harmless to keep a beautiful woman\u2019s phone number.\n\nHowever, things were different now.\n\nHe swerved the steering wheel abruptly and turned around in the opposite direction. He accelerated to 200 miles an hour, and threw Lorenzo off his trail.\n\nChapter 0005\nXavier was driving dangerously fast, but his expression was exceptionally calm.\n\nIn addition to running several companies, he was also a part-time F2 racing driver.\n\nFor Lorenzo, the supercar was just a means of transportation, but in Xavier's hands, it was a toy. He was sure that Lorenzo would not be able to catch up.\n\nLorenzo watched Xavier's car zoom by his car like a ghost. He was stunned for a moment and quickly turned around. Two minutes later, he lost them.\n\nHe continued to call Xavier while flooring the accelerator, but still no one answered.\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier knew that he had other intentions when he ditched Lorenzo, but he dared not show it in front of Sydney right away.\n\nAfter all, she was still Lorenzo's wife. Xavier was one year younger than Lorenzo whom he regarded as his blood brother, so she was his sister-in-law, in a sense.\n\nHe took her to the hospital as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter the medical check-up to make sure there were no major problems, Xavier took Sydney back to Celestial Park after applying ice patches to her face.\n\nCelestial Park was a famous luxury residential area in Quill City. Sydney and Lorenzo bought their marital home here.\n\nAs soon as Sydney got to the bedroom, she saw Lorenzo sitting on the sofa at the end of the bed. There was a bottle of white wine on the round table next to him.\n\nSydney's eyes flashed. Without saying a word, she went to bed, lay down, and closed her eyes.\n\nA few seconds later, the man's footsteps were heard.\n\nSydney shivered. Her eyelashes became wet again.\n\nLorenzo suddenly got on the bed and pressed on her. She opened her eyes and started to push him away. \"Don't touch me...\"\n\nLorenzo paused, grabbed her collar with both hands, and tore her skirt apart.\n\nSydney's eyes widened with shock. Her screams echoed through the bedroom. \"Don't touch me with the hand you used to touch Chelsea Dune!\"\n\nLorenzo froze.\n\nSydney looked at him as tears poured down her face. \"I can have no dignity in front of you because we were dependent on each other for those four years. You provided a great deal for me, and you are also the closest person to me besides my mother and grandmother. My heart breaks for you because you were hurt by what happened back then. I can\u2019t bear to see you in deep pain every day because of me so I allow you to vent your grievances by hurting me!\n\n\u201cBut I can't share the same man with Chelsea, and I can't have the hand that touched her, touch me!!\n\n\u201cShe is the last straw of my dignity, Lorenzo!\"\n\nHowever, these words did not move Lorenzo to show any guilt.\n\nInstead, he became angrier. \"What about my last straw?\"\n\n\"I was disgusted by you too after Oliver touched you. What you do that night when we got registered?\"\n  \nSydney trembled. She choked.\n\nThat night.\n  \nHer mother and mother-in-law both wanted to seize the opportunity so that she and Lorenzo could have a child as soon as possible, so they tampered with their tea.\n\nLorenzo thought it was Sydney who Framed him.\n\n\"Why aren't you talking?\" Lorenzo's eyes were red as he stared into hers, \"Where did Xavier take you? He deliberately didn't answer my call. What did you do?\"\n\n\"Can you stop being suspicious of everyone and anyone? He took me to the hospital!\"\n\n\"Hospital?\" Lorenzo sneered, and he tightened his grip on her clothes, this time tearing her skirt all the way, \"Sydney, lift your legs for me!\"\n\nSydney panicked. \"What are you going to do?!\"\n\n\"Let's see if you betrayed me again!\"\n\nSydney immediately closed her knees together, \"I didn't!\"\n\nLorenzo pressed harder and his voice became more forceful, \"I don't believe a word you said!\"\n\nSuch stubborn words made Sydney lose the will to refute him.\n\nShe looked at Lorenzo\u2019s frightening and gloomy face and felt disgusted with him for the first time.\n\nShe reached out and pinched the back of his hand. \"Let me go, I'm tired, I want to sleep!\"\n\n\"I don't want to sleep, why should you sleep!\" Lorenzo was still furious. He did not seem to feel any pain in the back of his hand. The grip in his hand became stronger and stronger.\n\nHe pulled apart Sydney's knees quickly. He spread her legs apart so hard that even her behinds hurt.\n\nHe was worried that she would resist, so he pressed his knee on her belly and untied his belt.\n\nSydney's tears rolled to the side of her temples and wet the pillow. Still, she said nothing. Since pinching the back of his hand did not work, she pinched his neck hard.\n\nLorenzo winced in pain, but still did not let her go.\n\nIt felt as if he would not give up if he did not test her.\n\nLorenzo's neck,and even his arms and abdominal muscles were left bruised from Sydney's pinching while she gradually lost hope.\n\nShe wilted like dry roses, losing all trace of vitality.\n\nLorenzo endured the pain and tried to control her, but failed.\n\nSydney's tearful eyes trembled. Her hand squeezing his chest loosened, and she finally spoke again, \"Is that enough?\"\n\n\"Enough?\" Unexpectedly, Lorenzo felt even more enraged. He reached out and yanked open the drawer on the bedside table, took out the bottle of essential oil she bought, and then slammed the drawer shut!\n\nSydney seized this opportunity and tried to escape, but he grabbed her ankle in time. \"Be good!\"\n\nSydney stopped resisting. She knew she would not be able to escape tonight.\n\nShe was in tears, but she laughed. \"Lorenzo, I really didn't expect that one day I would be disgusted with you. Go ahead, disgust me more. So I can hate you enough, and give you what you want...\"\n\nShe thought, \u2018Lorenzo should know what I was referring to.\u2019\n\nIn the split second, her refusal to sign the divorce agreement suddenly wavered.\n\nDuring the time between being taken away by Xavier and being sent back home, she had been recalling the past.\n\nWhen she recalled the past with Chelsea, she did not want to lose her self-esteem. However, when she recalled every moment with Lorenzo, she did not want to regret losing the man she loved most.\n\nShe was deeply confused by these opposing feelings.\n\nHowever, right now, she actually felt disgusted with the man she loved most.\n\nShe was glad.\n\nDisgusted by him meant that she could finally let him go one day. \n\nLorenzo's face darkened at Sydney\u2019s words. He could not tell whether he was angry or something else.\n\nShe wanted to say more, but Lorenzo's lips suddenly covered hers.\n\nAt the same time, his fingertips of both hands trailed up along her waistline.\n\nThe faint smell of tobacco mixed with the fragrance and wine was an alluring masculine aroma. In the past, she could never resist his kisses.\n\nLorenzo was even wilder in the past than he is now. He was like a lion in the savanna. The passion and impulse he made her feel was strong and without restraint.\n\nApart from the four years they were separated, they had slept together for four years until now. He understood every part of her body, her preferred tension and pressure.\n\nSoon, her body reacted uncontrollably."

There were two pieces of good news to celebrate today: my 3rd wedding anniversary and the fact that I'd just gotten a promotion.\nI walk eagerly to the man I love, stretching onto my toes to kiss Ryan. But he ducks, pushing something into my arms.\nWhen I unwrapped it, my whole body froze.\nA divorce document.\n\u201cThat's what I want. \u201c Ryan said coldly. His arms crossed over his chest.\u201d Honestly, I'm sick and tired of this. You're not taking care of our home. \u201d\nIt took me a minute to comprehend the current situation.\u201d It wasn't April Fool's Day. \u201d\nExasperated, Ryan rolls his angry eyes at me and gestures to the room around us. \u201c Do you know what it\u2019s like to walk into a room with cat hair everywhere and a carpet that hasn\u2019t been cleaned in months? \u201d\nMy eyes widen, my head pulling back to look at my husband. \u201cLet me remind you that I make twice as much as you do and that I am the one who pays for the cleaners. Yet, I distinctly remember conversing with you a long time ago where we agreed to take turns dividing our workload!\u201d\nThe counter-argument makes Ryan grunt, throwing his head back as he stares at the ceiling. \u201cI earn money too, Esme!\u201d He snaps at me.\n\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem here?\u201d\n\u201cThe problem? Why don\u2019t I have a housewife? You can\u2019t even be bothered to bring me a child to raise!\u201d\n\u201cMe? You do realize I want to have this baby, too, right? You\u2019re the one who refuses to go with me to the hospital! Maybe if you were a bit more active\u2014\u201d\nRyan interrupts me with a laugh that silences me.\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d He spits, seemingly implying that I\u2019m a liar. \u201cYou\u2019re having an affair with your boss; don\u2019t deny it!\u201d\nMr. Anderson? Derek Anderson? The confusion seems to proliferate, and the facial expressions that take over my face feel like a dream.\nThe only thing that is true about my boss is that he\u2019s a dashing divorced man. I\u2019m dazed at the idea my husband accuses me of sneaking behind his back.\n\u201cI can absolutely assure you, Ryan, that there never has and never will be anything regarding my boss! I am his subordinate, and there\u2019s nothing left to discuss about Mr. Anderson!\u201d\nHis arms cross over his chest again, huffing. \u201cYou\u2019re so delusional that your work has given you everything you desire when, in fact, it is your boss.\u201d\n\u201cFine. You want this divorce and to live in your fantasy world where I\u2019m the villain? I\u2019ll sign your freaking divorce papers, but not right now. For now, I\u2019m going to find a competent lawyer to help me properly divide my property from you.\u201d\nI start rushing toward the front door, needing to escape this house, this man, this absurdity.\nBut I hear Ryan chasing me down the hall. \u201cEsme! Quit stalling for more time or to conjure up new lies. If you have a clean conscience, then you should sign the papers today.\u201d\nHe grabs my arm and whirls me around, and for the first time since I met Ryan, I don\u2019t recognize the man. His eyes are dark, his skin ice cold as his fingers wrap around my upper arm, and his voice full of disgust.\nI shake my head, ripping my arm from his grasp, slap my husband in the face, and I leave the house with papers in hand and my heart bleeding on the floor in front of the man.\nHappy anniversary to me.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to murder the scum!\u201d\nMy best friends, Annie and Lily, sit at the bar on either side of me. Ransom\u2019s Tavern is our favorite place to drown our sorrows, and Lily is basically ready to go all Jeffery Dahmer on Ryan.\n\u201cAnd on your anniversary of all days! Who asks for a divorce on the day two people get married? He better be ready for me because I\u2019m going to end his entire life with one freaking punch to the face!\u201d\nI can\u2019t help but laugh at Lily as she puts up her fists like she\u2019s preparing for battle. Her nose scrunches up, and her eyebrows hide behind her brown bangs.\n\u201cCalm yourself,\u201d Annie instructs our friend.\n\u201cCalm? How can you be calm? He\u2019s just told our best friend that she\u2019s only where she is in her career because she\u2019s been sleeping with her boss! Do you know how incredibly misogynistic and disgusting that is?\u201d\n\u201cTalk louder; I don\u2019t think the entire block heard you,\u201d I reply as I take a drink. This is the last thing I need. I rub my left temple, my curly blonde hair quickly becoming tangled in my fingers.\n\u201cMoving on!\u201d Annie instructs, waving her perfectly manicured hand at Lily. Then, touching my hand on the sticky bar, Annie states seriously, \u201cEsme, if I were you, I\u2019d go to your boss\u2019 house and sleep with him. Now.\u201d\nI roll my eyes as I give the two women a sad smile. \u201cCome on, my boss isn\u2019t like you, guys. He\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s got a lot of responsibilities on his plate.\u201d\n\u201cUh, isn\u2019t your boss single now?\u201d Lily questions.\nI shrug, taking another sip of my watery beer. \u201cHe\u2019s got two daughters, and from what I\u2019ve heard, he takes care of them independently.\u201d\n\u201cAka, he\u2019s single and maybe ready to mingle?\u201d Annie teases, biting her bottom lip at her joke.\nI nudge my shoulder against hers, unable to keep a laugh from rising out of me. \u201cStop it!\u201d\nI wouldn\u2019t be shocked if Anderson is single, especially since he never works overtime. He always leaves as soon as the clock strikes five like Cinderella leaving the ball at midnight.\nBut as I sit here, I start to wonder if the booze has already saturated my mind. Because suddenly, Anderson is all I\u2019m able to think about.\nWho would it hurt if I were to maybe\u2026text him? Ryan would be furious, absolutely floored at my gall. But my anger, my desire to hurt the man who I\u2019d married three years ago, fuels my rage.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to text him,\u201d I tell the girls, pulling out my phone. I\u2019m going to tell him exactly where I am right now and use this to relieve some of the anger.\nGetting back at Ryan for his selfish and pathetic behavior? Better than giving him a swift kick in his special little place.\n\u201cNo way. Prove it!\u201d Annie smirks, looking down at my phone lying on the bar.\nI pick up the phone, typing in Anderson\u2019s name in my messages. I\u2019ll send him my address as if supposedly informing a friend of my whereabouts. Then, after about a minute, I\u2019ll just tell him I\u2019d sent the message to the wrong person.\nNo harm, no foul.\nBesides, it\u2019s already 8:45. It must be parenting time for Anderson.\nI type in the address to Ransom\u2019s Tavern and hit send. I put down the phone, my friends laughing and shoving me with disbelief.\nTo my surprise, my phone buzzes back immediately with a reply.\n\u201cFive minutes.\u201d\n\nChapter 2\n\u201cNo way, no way!\u201d Annie squeals as she grabs my phone from my hands. Her pale blue eyes sparkle with mischief. \u201cLily, he\u2019s coming!\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Lily shouts, reaching across me to take my phone next, pushing a piece of her short brown hair away from her face.\n\u201cThis is absolutely crazy. I can\u2019t even believe it! Five minutes? That\u2019s so fast!\u201d Annie cries, her arm catapulting back for the phone.\n\u201cOh my God, I\u2019m so excited, I can\u2019t wait to see what he looks like!\u201d Lily adds, jumping in her bar seat with excitement.\nThe two of them are growing louder by the second, and now I\u2019m starting to get a headache and regret my message.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you just point out that he\u2019s got two daughters? It\u2019s a school night. He\u2019s probably spending time with the kids,\u201d Lily points out as Annie re-reads the texts for the tenth time.\n\u201cWhat do you think this means?\u201d Annie asks, still staring at my phone.\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll bring them along,\u201d Lily gushes.\nI\u2019m too stunned to say anything. Did I really do this to myself? I can\u2019t even believe it!\nAs if a magic wand is waved over my head, I feel the drunkenness clears up instantly, and now I\u2019m sweating from every possible place I can think of.\n\u201cHe\u2026he must have thought I was contacting him for a work-related matter,\u201d I find myself stammering to the girls. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly dedicated.\u201d\nAnnie shakes her head. \u201cExcept this is outside of work hours, honey. Besides, he knows this is a pub, yet here he is, rushing over like your knight in shining armor!\u201d\nShe and Lily scream again, their bodies jumping up and down in the bar seats as they shake their arms in the air.\nWell, if the drunkenness has left, then bring on the hangover because I am far too sober for this.\nI\u2019m honestly speechless now. My friends must be overthinking things, surely. I mean, Anderson is just so professional in the office. He cares for his subordinates, and I know that.\nBesides, I\u2019ve never messaged him outside of the working hours in the past, so that must have made him inclined to believe it must be something serious.\nEven if that\u2019s not the case, I can\u2019t help but continue panicking in my head over the fact Anderson will be here soon.\nAs the end of the five minutes approaches, Lily and Annie decide to step aside to let me handle this situation on my own. They sit at a table in the back of the bar, watching me like I\u2019m their newest form of entertainment.\nI better come up with a perfect lie. I\u2019m starting to sweat and growing more nervous by the second for Anderson to show up. Maybe something about how work has been a struggle, or I\u2019ve had a few difficult clients?\nAs the thoughts run through my head, they\u2019re quickly sent away when Anderson walks into the bar in an elegant, perfectly tailored suit. His eyes search for me before landing on the bar, and he smiles gently.\nStanding at what I can imagine to be over six feet tall, Derek Anderson is a white yet tanned man in his late thirties with dark brown hair on his head. He has his usual dark smudges under his eyes, which match his exhaustion. He\u2019s also just about one of the most good-looking men I\u2019ve ever seen.\nI quickly scramble to my feet once he enters, realizing I have absolutely no idea what I must look like. A wreck, probably, considering I just got dumped by my own husband. Is my hair okay? What about my makeup?\nOh man, what about my breath?\nAnderson approaches, keeping his smile spread out on his face. I take a deep breath, and tell myself to calm down.\n\u201cCongratulations on your promotion, Esme,\u201d Anderson says once he\u2019s closed the distance. He looks really good tonight.\n\u201cT-Thank you,\u201d I stutter out, trying to keep my composure. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to taking on the new responsibilities.\u201d\nWe both sit at the bar together, still keeping one another in our line of sight.\nI do put a lot of time into my job, and it is genuinely rewarding and fulfilling. I mean, the years I\u2019ve put into it have given me such a rush of pride. But thinking of Ryan\u2019s complaints scratches at the surface of my skin.\n\u201cI brought you a gift to celebrate,\u201d Anderson states, holding out a small bag for me to take from him.\nSurprised, I reached out for the bag. What could he have possibly grabbed for me in the five minutes it took for him to arrive?\n\u201cThank you, Mr. Anderson, that\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d\nHe gestures to the bag. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you open it?\u201d\nI look down at the bag, feeling awkward about opening his gift right here, but do as he asks.\nI can\u2019t contain my absolute shock when I pull the gift out of the bag. A jewelry box?\nI slowly open the box, seeing a beautiful necklace inside. My jaw drops.\n\u201cW-w-what? How did you\u2014?\u201d\nAnderson gives me a sheepish smile, nodding at the box. \u201cI happened to notice your phone\u2019s wallpaper recently, and\u2026\u201d He rubs the back of his neck. \u201cI hope that it wasn\u2019t too personal.\u201d\nI can\u2019t hide my stunned expression. This is so thoughtful of Anderson, and I raise my eyes to his. How do I even thank him for this?\nThe necklace, a beautiful silver chain with a dark blue heart wrapped around it, was supposed to be a gift hint for Ryan to find. I picked it out because I knew how perfect it would match my own dark blue eyes.\nI\u2019ve been eyeing this for weeks and was so, so hopeful he would figure out my desire to own it.\nI\u2019m so confused because this is like my dream wedding anniversary! Though, in reality, it\u2019s all a mess\u2014yet here I stand with my own boss, my eyes wide and mouth agape as I hold onto the beautiful jewelry.\nThis is Anderson handing over this gift, though. Not my own husband.\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting a divorce!\u201d I blurt out without a thought.\nMy boss\u2019s expression morphs, and he gives off a strange expression. \u201cSorry?\u201d He questions.\nAt this very moment, I notice something pink on the corner of Anderson\u2019s suit. Is that\u2026Peppa Pig? A sticker?\nGod, what the heck am I doing? This is my boss! He\u2019s a mature man with children and professional conduct. A full-fledged, single father with no need for some random employee to take up his incredibly important time.\nI take one deep breath, then another. Calm down a second. This day has been such a whirlwind that I must have gotten swept up in the kind gesture from Anderson.\nMy nerves are growing, and I feel inexplicably and desperately wanting to escape this incredibly awkward situation. My personal life doesn\u2019t need to be brought up in front of Anderson, so what am I doing talking to him like we\u2019re old friends catching up?\nOut of professionalism, it\u2019s imperative that my personal matters are handled privately and have nothing to do with him. What am I even doing calling him to the bar and divulging that I\u2019m leaving Ryan behind?\nAbruptly, I make my voice sound natural, though it doesn\u2019t feel as such. \u201cWhat I meant to say was,\u201d I start, another breath to calm myself. \u201cI\u2019d like to request time off.\u201d\nAnderson raises his left eyebrow.\nI nearly cough. \u201cI need to handle the\u2026related paperwork, if that\u2019s okay, sir?\u201d\nIt feels like a bowling ball has landed on my chest as I watch his expression go unchanging. God, of all the times, to sound like a complete bumbling mess, it has to be in front of my boss.\n\nChapter 3\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d Anderson asks after the silence becomes too stuffy. He\u2019s frowning slightly, and I notice his posture slightly worsen.\nIn my head, I\u2019m thinking, What else? After all, when he arrived, he had no clue about my fight with Ryan. Does he even know today was our anniversary?\nFor some reason, as I continue to stare at the man, I feel a sense of something. Is it\u2026disappointment? Why?\nInstead of probing him with more questions, I nod my head up at the tall man. His eyes, dark and honestly somewhat mysterious, crash against my skin like a hot laser burning into me.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all, yes,\u201d I finally reply.\nI look at Anderson, and then my eyes drift over to Annie and Lily in the corner of the bar. They\u2019re watching so intensely you\u2019d think they've never seen two people interact before. I feel severe discomfort with their daggers.\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Anderson says, straightening his suit jacket. \u201cYour time off is approved. If there is anything else I can do for you, please let me know.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I say to him, wanting to give a smile but struggling to let myself give one away. He\u2019s a kind man, and I appreciate his understanding.\n\u201cOf course. Though, I have one more question, Esme.\u201d\nI turn my head to the side at the statement.\n\u201cAre you here alone tonight?\u201d Anderson\u2019s voice seems to warble a bit, and it throws me off for a moment. Did it matter if I\u2019m here by myself or not?\nNot wanting to lie but still feeling a bit nervous, I nod my head again. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d\nAnderson stands back up to depart, wiping something off of his jacket. As he does this, a waiter comes up to me and deposits a drink in front of me.\n\u201cOh, no, I didn\u2019t order\u2014\u201d I start to say, unsure where this mystery drink came from.\n\u201cCharge it double and put it on my tab,\u201d Anderson deadpans, handing over his card to the waiter, who quickly swipes it through and gives it back.\n\u201cSir, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d\nBefore I can speak, Anderson returns the card to his pocket. \u201cGoodnight, Esme. I hope your paperwork is sorted out shortly.\u201d\n\u201cBut sir, you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d I\u2019m sputtering, but he holds up his hand to stop my sentence again.\n\u201cEnjoy your night.\u201d\nAnderson then walks out of the bar alone, and I can\u2019t help but stare in disbelief at the man as he disappears behind the walls. What the heck just happened?\nThat was all so weird, and I\u2019m struggling to find any words to say now that I\u2019ve been left alone at the bar.\nIt takes another few seconds, but Annie and Lily come rushing over with bright eyes. I can tell the two are ready to start interrogating me for what happened between us, but in truth, I don\u2019t have any words for them.\nInstead, all I can do is gesture with my hands at what is before me. The necklace, the drink, and my confusion are all present.\nI want to tell them I don\u2019t know what happened, but I think my face is saying that enough. Because I don\u2019t know anything. This was all just\u2026random?\nLily, snickering to herself, mimics Anderson under her breath with her large smile. \u201cI\u2019ll pay double.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d Annie pushes, and I just shrug.\n\u201cOh, come on! He walks in here and hands you some fancy jewelry and then hands over his card without even knowing what you\u2019re drinking. That was him clearly flirting!\u201d Lily says dreamily.\n\u201cHardly,\u201d my voice croaks.\n\u201cHow many men would come into this bar and do the exact same thing, though, Esme?\u201d Annie insists. \u201cThat man just swept you off your feet!\u201d\nI look at the door where Anderson exited, wanting to ask him what is going through his head. But that\u2019s the issue. Now he\u2019s left again, and I\u2019m left wondering what this day has turned into.\nA freaking fiasco, for sure.\nLater, after finally getting Lily and Annie to let me leave the bar and return home, I climb into my empty bed.\nAlone for the first time in years, I feel helpless over my foreseeable future. It\u2019s hard to judge whether things will be good or not with Ryan already pushing and shoving his way out the door.\nWhat am I supposed to do about all of this? Today should have been perfect. Ryan could have swept me off my feet, and we could have had a romantic dinner together, shared gifts and kisses and laughter, and enjoyed ourselves. Instead, here I am, holding back tears against my pillow.\nI got a promotion, and on my wedding anniversary at the age of 30, I\u2019m about to lose my marriage. What\u2019s worse is I\u2019m still childless, which causes my heart to strain. I don\u2019t want that label. I don\u2019t want that nightmare.\nNow, I\u2019m going to be the divorced single woman everywhere I try to go.\nOr, maybe, a single, divorced career woman.\nThough, that seems to be even more stressful than the divorced woman label.\nI shake my head out on the pillow, throwing my face into the sheet. This is all happening so bloody fast that I\u2019m unsure what else to do.\nAnd on top of everything bad that\u2019s happened today, I can\u2019t stop replaying Anderson\u2019s facial expressions and kindness toward me. He\u2019s a genuinely kind individual, so having him attempt to comfort me was sympathetic.\nI can\u2019t imagine Ryan doing the same for me, even if we are still married. His compassionate side has never been his strong suit.\nThen again, maybe I\u2019ve just been wearing rose-tinted glasses the whole time, and he was never a good husband to begin with. I guess it\u2019s possible to be lost in a world of love.\nGrunting and rolling over to get out of bed, I realize that sleep shall continue to evade unless I do something about it.\nGrabbing my wallet and a light jacket to cover my pajamas, I finally exit my place, trudging downstairs and out into the world to fix this incredibly horrid headache and insomnia.\nAround the corner from my place is a 24-hour convenience store. Maybe the clinic will have the meds I\u2019m looking for. Regardless, I\u2019m so over this day, and I just want to sleep and have it be tomorrow.\nThe best way forward is through, after all.\nI shuffle into the clinic, making my way to the medication section. I tend to pick up whatever the strongest medications happen to be on the shelf.\nAt this rate, they\u2019re going to need to make a simple medication to calm my anxiety, too.\nMaybe I should go back to the doctor. My insomnia hasn\u2019t really corrupted my sleep and made me this tired in years. But clearly, I\u2019ll be struggling for the foreseeable future.\nI shuffle into the next aisle to grab a large bottle of water to take with my meds. As I get to the front of the store to pay for my supplies, I hear a voice I recognize.\n\u201cIs this the right one, you think?\u201d He asks another person nearby.\nI stretch my neck, seeing the one person I\u2019m desperately trying not to think about.\nI see the short haired blonde first, and I\u2019m surprised to see Ryan standing in the aisle just to the left of me. Then, I hear a second voice.\n\u201cMaybe we get this one,\u201d she replies.\nI narrow my eyes, and as I thank the man at the counter, I walk over to the two people.\nIt\u2019s Ryan alright, but the person he\u2019s with?\nMy cousin, Melinda. With her picture-perfect beauty and her short black hair pulled into a pathetic excuse for a ponytail, I look at the two of them down the aisle.\nAnd the object they\u2019re talking about is a freaking test stick?\n\nChapter 4\n\u201cYou really had to do this to me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Melinda complains as they pick up another stick to examine. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have used protection before you got the divorce?\u201d\n\u201cBabe, it\u2019s going to be fine because we\u2019re going to be divorced soon! Esme\u2014that freaking foolish woman\u2014she\u2019s got no idea about us! Besides, she\u2019s got significantly more savings than I do, and soon, we\u2019re going to inherit a fortune!\u201d\n\u201cYou better hope so, dummy,\u201d Melinda grunts as she turns the pink box over in her hands. \u201cThis is stressing me out.\u201d\n\u201cLook, we\u2019ll inherit the money, we\u2019ll be rich, and you and I will be together. You should get knocked up immediately, unlike Esme. She can\u2019t even have kids!\u201d\nI feel my heart turn cold, my skin burns, and my anger blinds me. This cheater! This whole time, I thought our main issue was over not having children!\nMy fingers strain around the bottles I hold, and a million different things cross my mind to screech at these two people; people I trusted!\nThis entire marriage has never hindered kids; it\u2019s only ever been for Ryan to divorce me and take my money! That spineless, pathetic scum.\n\u201cMelinda! What the heck?\u201d I screech at the two, giving away my position. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you got into bed with him!\u201d\nThe two of them turn to look at me, eyebrows raised, and, at least in my cousin\u2019s face, a slight hint of fear.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Ryan demands.\n\u201cHearing you plan your new life.\u201d I glower at my soon-to-be ex-husband. \u201cYou really think I\u2019m this foolish?\u201d\n\u201cOh no, I don\u2019t think it, I know it!\u201d Ryan retorts back.\nI look straight at my cousin, my eyes falling into slits as I speak the truth. \u201cI don\u2019t have children. No. But maybe that\u2019s because this man\u2019s got useless seeds.\u201d\nI jab a finger in Ryan\u2019s direction. \u201cI won\u2019t let you parasites take a single penny from me! This is freaking war.\u201d\nI stomp out of the pharmacy with a new purpose and officially wide awake. I\u2019m not letting this ship go down. Just the opposite: I\u2019m going to ruin their lives.\nI\u2019m getting a lawyer, gathering all the evidence, and I\u2019m taking them down every peg possible.\nBut first, I need to move out of this place. The thought of Ryan and Melinda doing it in my bed makes me want to vomit.\nI spend the night putting together what I can find, refusing to let sleep take me away from my work.\nOnce the sun comes up, I start chugging coffee, heading into the office to ask if any of my colleagues know anything about nearby rental options.\nI let myself get lost in my job and rental searches, frantic as I let the day whiz by me. It\u2019s not until I stop for a moment in the daze of anger and work that I realize two things:\nThe first one is that I told Anderson I needed time off, and I still came into the office today.\nThe second one is that it\u2019s almost five, and I have two messages from my boss asking me to come to his office when I have a moment.\n\u201cHeck!\u201d I whisper. I stand up abruptly, grab my phone, and throw it into my pocket, rushing down the hall to Anderson\u2019s office. God, this is going to look really weird, isn\u2019t it?\nI knock on the door and straighten myself out, but in my head, I know I\u2019m going to look like a mess.\n\u201cCome in,\u201d I hear Anderson call, and I slowly open the door.\n\u201cHi,\u201d I say shyly, moving forward into the room.\n\u201cAh, Esme,\u201d he smiles. He gestures at me. \u201cCome in, close the door behind you.\u201d\nOh God, am I being fired?\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, I didn\u2019t see your messages until just now. I was busy with my work.\u201d\nHe nods but tells me to sit down. \u201cNo problem, I just wanted to discuss something with you.\u201d\nThe moment my body touches the soft cushion of the chair, I\u2019m quick to explain. \u201cI completely forgot that I\u2019d asked for time off, and then I didn\u2019t even remember until I read your messages! I\u2019m so sorry for\u2014\u201d\nHe holds up a hand to stop me, and I listen, confused. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I called you in here.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d I say, shrinking into the chair. If I could just disappear into thin air right now, that\u2019d be wonderful.\n\u201cI did, however, want to ask you if you\u2019re alright. You do seem a bit\u2026tense.\u201d\nI need the power of invisibility right about now.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I lie.\n\u201cAnd the conversations around the office about you looking for rental options?\u201d\nHeck, I\u2019ve been caught.\n\u201cAre you looking for a place, Esme?\u201d He asks again.\nHe must have listened in on one of those conversations because I only spoke to a few people, and they were relatively short ones.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, really, I hope you can understand that this has been a difficult time for me. I\u2019m sorry for discussing personal matters during work hours.\u201d\nHe raises his hands to me to calm me.\n\u201cEsme, take a breath. It\u2019s fine; we have a comprehensive employee care system.\u201d Anderson gives me a deep look, seemingly looking for something. \u201cConsidering your\u2026special situation, the company has some housing allowances for employees.\u201d\nI sit up straighter. \u201cReally?\u201d\nThe man nods. \u201cYes.\u201d\nI let a long sigh out. \u201cOh, wow, okay, thank you, sir. And thank you for not telling anyone about the divorce. I haven\u2019t told anyone, and I\u2019m not exactly ready for the entire thing to go public.\u201d\nHe nods again. \u201cThat\u2019s tough, and I understand.\u201d\nI feel compelled to apologize again; this information on the housing is incredibly helpful, and I\u2019m so sleep-deprived that it actually seems like a good idea to shake his hand and give him a hug.\nGet your things together, Esme.\nHis small smile and that nod, however, make me feel a special spark ripple through me. Finally, someone understands and has given me the best encouragement I\u2019ve received yet.\nI\u2019m so grateful for his kindness, but a few tears prickle the corners of my eyes. Something about his stature and genuine concern for my well-being and home life makes me feel closer to Anderson than to my own friends.\n\u201cI appreciate the information and for everything you\u2019ve done for me, sir.\u201d\n\u201cMy best employee deserves to know that she is a valuable member to the team. If you\u2019re not in top fighting shape, then we all lose, correct?\u201d\nI nod vigorously. \u201cOf course, yes.\u201d\n\u201cVery well. Go speak to Mrs. Halloway on the third floor about your housing request, and she should be able to get everything sorted out for you today. Hurry, though, she\u2019ll be leaving any minute.\u201d\nI jump up, and without really thinking, I get moving, calling over my shoulder my appreciation once more.\nAs I rush down the stairs, I remind myself that Anderson is also divorced. He\u2019s even got two little girls to take care of. Maybe, this is a shared sympathy?\nHe must know the torture I\u2019ve been enduring since Ryan\u2019s heinous words last night. A divorce is a painful process.\nI believe, however, that my situation is guaranteed worse than anyone will know.\nI manage to catch Mrs. Halloway as she\u2019s putting her papers together to leave. She is kind enough to sit with me for twenty minutes after five as we sign papers, and I\u2019m given the keys to a new apartment to live in.\nI call Annie and Lily in hopes the two women can help me move out tonight. The sooner I\u2019m out of this place, the better.\nAs we\u2019re putting my things into boxes as quickly as possible, the girls prod me with a bunch of questions.\nClearly, everything is moving quickly to them.\n\u201cYou said this is company-provided housing?\u201d Annie asks, incredulous.\n\nChapter 5\nI smile, pushing some curly blonde hair behind my ear and out of my eyes. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d\n\u201cHow much is your rent going to cost?\u201d Lily jumps in.\nI think for a second, putting books into another box. \u201cUh, about two thousand.\u201d\nLily throws a pillow at me, pursing her red lips in my direction as she waves her arms around in the air. \u201cI\u2019m going to murder you!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I laugh, unsure what she\u2019s talking about.\n\u201cI never envied your promotion; everyone knows how hard you work. If I worked late like you, my face would collapse!\u201d\nAnnie says, \u201cBut this, I cannot forgive you for!\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I question, hands on my waist.\nThe two girls look at one another before returning their gazes to me.\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Annie replies, rolling her eyes.\n\u201cCity center,\u201d Lily ticks on her finger.\n\u201cOne thousand square meters,\u201d Annie says next.\n\u201cFully furnished apartment.\u201d\n\u201cSwimming pool, security, a gym downstairs.\u201d\n\u201cOnly 100 meters from the closest shopping center!\u201d\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to kick you out after you\u2019ve signed the contract.\u201d Lily crosses her arms with a satisfying smirk on her face.\nI roll my eyes and sigh but understand they\u2019re having fun at my expense. \u201cGirls, this is the employee care system, okay? I\u2019m getting a divorce.\u201d\nI point at Lily. \u201cAnd you? With one handsome boyfriend after another.\u201d Then, I point at the tall blonde. \u201cAnd you, with a husband that absolutely adores you! Life is fair for the two of you, and there\u2019s no need to be jealous of my pathetic life.\u201d\nI let myself fall to the ground with my legs crossed, exhausted.\nAnnie approaches me, her hand on my shoulder. \u201cWe know, hon,\u201d she reassures me.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re sorry you\u2019re going through all of this right now,\u201d Lily adds, joining us on the floor.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to keep you as happy as we can,\u201d the first woman insists. \u201cYou\u2019re our best friend, Esme, and we just want you to smile.\u201d\nI take both girls around the shoulders and hold them close, so thankful to have the two greatest friends on the planet.\n\u201cWhat the heck would I do without you two?\u201d\nLily shrugs against my embrace. \u201cYou\u2019d probably be packing this place by yourself?\u201d\nAnnie nods matter-of-factly. \u201cAlso, no one would be here to taunt you.\u201d\n\u201cOr remind you that Ryan\u2019s a loser, and you\u2019re a thousand times better off without him!\u201d\n\u201cPlus, then you\u2019d have no one to invite to your new, beautiful, stunning apartment!\u201d Annie finishes, clapping her hands together as I let them both go.\n\u201cYou two are absolutely ridiculous!\u201d I roll my eyes.\n\u201cBut you love us!\u201d They sing song together.\nIt takes only a few hours of rushed packing to get out of the house I\u2019ve lived in for the past several years. I look around one more time once the girls have left, saying goodbye to pieces of my home that will no longer be mine.\nThe perfect window perch to look out at the view around me.\nThe spot on the wooded living room floor where I\u2019d spilled just a touch of black nail polish.\nThe perfect shower and bath combo that I used to lie in for hours at a time enjoying the calm.\nThe walk-in closet is mostly barren now.\nThe steps that I\u2019d tripped down the first time I got a promotion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to say goodbye,\u201d I whisper to the house. The creaks and the shadows that I\u2019ve grown so used to will just become a faded memory. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d\nA creak in the ceiling sounds as if the home is replying to my final words.\n\u201cThank you for these past few years,\u201d I finish, standing in the middle of the living room and taking one final deep breath in.\nThen, I take off my wedding ring and place it on the kitchen table next to my house key. This is it. This is the end of my story here.\nI grab my car keys off the counter by the front door, take one more look around, and then I finally make my exit, knowing there\u2019s no chance I\u2019ll ever walk through this door again.\nI\u2019m no longer Esme, Ryan\u2019s wife.\nNow I\u2019m Esme, a strong, independent woman who is relearning the world around her.\n\u201cYou took your sweet time,\u201d Lily taunts as I finally get into my car downstairs.\n\u201cJust needed to say goodbye,\u201d I insist.\n\u201cOnly you would say goodbye to a freaking house,\u201d Annie says, poking my arm from the passenger seat. Her nails are white today, and I swat her hand away.\n\u201cLet\u2019s gooo, come on!\u201d Lily cries, holding out the second word to annoy us. She jumps up and down in the backseat. \u201cOnward to new adventures, Esme!\u201d\nThe drive to the new apartment isn\u2019t too far. It\u2019s about ten minutes away from the house, and surprisingly, it\u2019s pretty close to our favorite dive, Ransom\u2019s Tavern. That\u2019s pretty perfect since it\u2019s the middle point for all three of us.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Annie whispers as she looks out the window on her side of the car. \u201cLook how beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you said the city center, you really meant it,\u201d I reply to the two, leaning forward in my car to see the apartment building as it towers over us.\n\u201cThe name fits well, too,\u201d Lily adds, pointing out the window ahead of us. I follow her gaze as I see the plaque.\n\u201cCenter City Apartments.\u201d\n\u201cThis is nuts,\u201d I say without really thinking about it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling us,\u201d Lily huffs. \u201cHeck, Esme.\u201d\nWe get a parking spot to the elevators closest to where my unit is supposed to be, and the girls and I start planning our attack.\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s get the important stuff into the bedroom first, and then we\u2019ll grab everything else and put it in the living room,\u201d I instruct.\n\u201cGood plan,\u201d Annie nods, pulling her straight, blonde hair into a ponytail.\nWe spend about an hour just bringing things up to the apartment, moving quickly and laughing with one another about how dumb we all look doing this.\n\u201cHire movers next time!\u201d Lily grunts as she drops a box of clothes on the ground. \u201cIf I\u2019d known this was how I was spending tonight, I\u2019d have told you I was busy!\u201d\nAnnie bumps our friend as she walks by with another box of pictures and memorabilia. \u201cAt least if she hired movers, they\u2019d probably be hot!\u201d\nLily gasps. \u201cOh God, yes! They\u2019d probably be all hot and sweaty and look amazing. Instead, I stink, and I\u2019m tired and hungry!\u201d\nI throw the closest object at Lily, which just so happens to be my car keys. \u201cYou love me, and you\u2019d never leave me in the lurch.\u201d\nAnnie and Lily both shrug at the same time, and the three of us head back to the car for the final round of transferring my stuff.\nOnce we\u2019re done, the two girls decide to utilize the fully furnished couches, but I end up kicking them out so they can each go home and spend time with their men.\n\u201cCall us later if you need some talk therapy?\u201d Annie asks.\nI give her a hug. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me, I\u2019ll be sleeping for the next four days,\u201d Lily deadpans, so I shove her playfully before giving her a hug and watching the two head off together.\nI look around the apartment, not sure where to start. Maybe the best step is to be neighborly and go greet the people who live next store.\nI head out of the door and go to put my new key in my side pocket. However, I accidentally drop the metal onto the ground and crouch down to pick it up.\nSuddenly, as I\u2019m picking up the key, a little missile comes barreling toward me, and the blur crashes into my arms before falling to the ground.\nInstincts take over, and I quickly pick up the small child, an adorable little girl with dark hair. Instantly, she begins to cry as I hold her close and stand back up.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay!\u201d I tell her, bouncing her. \u201cDon\u2019t cry!\u201d\nI look around for an adult, but I\u2019m only met with another girl, a few years older than the first, who looks like a carbon copy. However, she is glaring at me.\n\u201cHow dare you make my sister cry!\u201d She shouts out. \u201cI\u2019m telling my dad on you!\u201d\nThen, as the older girl is yelling, a man in a bathrobe comes running out of the apartment next door, calling out his apologies for his daughter scaring me.\nThe first thing I see is a set of perfect abs, and I have a hard time pulling away from the sight. Wow, what a handsome set of abs.\nMy eyes move up from the abs to the eyes of the tall, tanned man. He looks incredibly relaxed and handsome as he stands in front of me, but it takes me about five seconds longer than it should to put it together.\nI can\u2019t help but gulp as I set down the girl in my arms.\nMy boss\u2026he\u2019s my neighbor?!"

He teased her gently while she struggled to gather herself.\n\"B-Babe, someone might see us\u2026\" Jenna gasped again, trying to catch her breath.\nAngelo focused on her body, caressing them endlessly. \"No one's gonna catch us here, babe. Trust me.\"\nAngelo had invited Jenna to his condo near their school, saying he missed her. He waited in the elevator, texting that he was on his way. Suddenly, Angelo pulled Jenna by the waist into the elevator and kissed her passionately.\n\"I miss you, babe,\" he whispered, pressing the button to close the elevator to his unit on the 11th floor.\nTheir kisses were intense, and Jenna felt both thrilled and worried about the elevator opening and someone catching them.\nAngelo's hands roamed her body, caressing her back and sliding down to her waist. He was about to slip his fingers inside her trousers when she stopped his hand.\n\"B-Babe, not here,\" Jenna pleaded. \n\n\"Trust me, babe, this will be fun.\" Jenna was wearing a short skirt and a crop top, so Angelo had free rein over her body. His fingers were already inside her and she couldn't stop his hand. The sensation was too intense for Jenna to resist.\n\n\"Ooooh, baaabe,\" she gripped his neck.\nAngelo gazed at Jenna intensely while pleasuring her. His fingers moved in and out of her until Jenna felt something inside her.\n\"I couldn't suppress the pleasure anymore... Ahhhh\u2026\" Jenna hugged Angelo tightly, almost collapsing from exhaustion. \n\n\"Did you enjoy it, babe?\" he asked, grinning at her.\n\n\"Pervert!\" Jenna pretended to be annoyed as the elevator doors opened, and they stepped out.\n\n-\nAt Jenna's house. \n\n\"Jenna, wake up!\"\nShe jolted awake, holding her head and sighing. 'Ugh, I dreamt about Angelo again.'\nAngelo was her ex-boyfriend and her first in everything: first boyfriend, first love, first kiss, first bed experience.\nJenna didn't know why she kept thinking about him lately, even in her dreams. Maybe it was true what they said, \"First love never dies.\"\nAngelo came from a rich and influential family. He had a younger brother, Luke, who was expected to take over their family businesses. Unlike Angelo, Luke was carefree and a dandy. There was a three-year age gap between them.\nJenna felt sad remembering the past. She cried every time she thought about what had happened between her and Angelo. They never had a formal breakup\u2014she just left Elaraquinn without a word, too young to handle the pain of her first love.\n\u2018Why can't you move on, self? Why do you keep thinking about Angelo?' Jenna asked herself. \nMaybe it was because they had no closure, leaving endless questions in her mind. She cried again as she remembered the past.\n\u2018It's been two years, but the memories feel like it happened yesterday... When will I be able to move on? What am I doing to myself? Am I becoming a masochist? There are plenty of guys pursuing me, but I haven't said yes to any of them. I don't want to be unfair because deep down, I still love Angelo... It's still him.'\nJenna ended her internal monologue and got up. She had an interview for a secretary position at an accounting firm. Although she wanted to practice what she had learned as an accountant, she hadn't passed the CPA Board Exam after graduation and had traveled to Veloria. As a result, she decided to apply for the secretary position first.\nAfter showering, she put on her new outfit. \"I went shopping yesterday for my interview today. I need to impress my future boss.\"\nJenna smiled as she looked at herself in the mirror.\nJenna's POV:\nI'm half-American because my dad is American. Standing at 5\u201910\", people often tell me I could compete in beauty contests. They say my body is well-proportioned, with a small waist, and perfectly shaped behinds.\nNot to boast, but I'm also smart, though not the smartest. My mom is a retired teacher and my dad is a retired pilot. I'm an only child, and we live a comfortable life, but I've never relied on my parents. Even though they provide for my needs, I\u2019m not spoiled. I still prefer to earn my own money.\n'I'll wear a black V-neck blouse, but not vulgarly. I'll pair it with a white coat and long pants that fit my body shape\u2026\nI look sophisticated. Let's spray some perfume before leaving the room.'\n\"Mom, I won't have breakfast, okay? I might hit heavy traffic,\" I shouted as I said goodbye to my mom.\n\n\"Okay, take care, dear. I hope you get accepted at your new job,\" she shouted back while having breakfast with my dad in the garden.\n\"Thanks, Mom. Bye, Dad.\" I blew them a flying kiss and got into my car, waving as I drove away.\n\nI have missed being busy and am really excited about my new job. I'll do my best in my interview to get accepted. Although I'm sure I'll get it because my childhood friend, Jason Jones, offered me the job. He said his business partner needs a secretary.\nI've only been back in Elaraquinn for a month. I used to work as a model in Veloria. My cousin, Abby Miller, felt pity for me when Angelo and I broke up. She helped me get away from Elaraquinn.\n\nI worked as a model in Veloria for two years, participating in fashion shows, becoming a magazine cover model, and appearing on billboards for a famous makeup company. I exhausted myself to divert the emptiness I felt in my heart.\n\"You should come back home. We miss you,\" my mom said lovingly when I called her.\n\"Okay, Mom. I'll file for a vacation so we can bond,\" I replied, making my mom smile.\n\"Really? By the way, do you have a boyfriend there?\" she asked with a smile.\n\"Why are you asking that, Mom? You know I'm busy with work here.\" My mom knew why I went to Veloria. To get away from my heartache and move on. She didn't stop me from leaving because I was with Abby.\nI buried myself in work to forget, but when I returned to my apartment, he was still on my mind. Maybe that's how it is with your first love. How will I move on from this?\nI suddenly felt sad again as I pondered.\nI just realized I am already in the parking lot, lost in thought. I smiled bitterly.\nIt was 8:30 a.m. when I arrived at the AF Accounting Firm building. My interview was at 9:00 am, so I still had time to freshen up. AF Accounting Firm was one of the respected firms in Elaraquinn, with high-profile clients.\nI saw Jason waiting for me by the elevator.\n\"Hi, doll,\" Jason greeted me with a smile and kissed my cheek. He used to call me \"doll\" instead of \"beautiful\".\nJason and I are childhood friends from Ventus. My family and I moved to Vesperia for university, but we kept in touch. His family is extremely rich, and he manages their family business.\n\"Hi, hunk,\" I replied, using my nickname for him.\n\n\"How's Veloria? It seems you're getting more beautiful,\" Jason teased.\n\"Come on. I've been beautiful for a long time. You're just crazy about me, aren't you?\" I joked.\n\"It's your fault. You just won't say yes to being my girlfriend.\"\n\"Don't you dare add me to your collection unless you want my dad to bury you alive,\" I teased, making him laugh.\n\"By the way, are you ready? Your future boss is waiting in his office. If I knew you wanted to be a charming-tary, I would have hired you,\" he teased.\n\"Mr. Ferrer's secretary reportedly resigned, so he's urgently looking for a new one.\" Jason continued to chatter in the elevator as we headed to the 18th floor where the CEO's office of AF Accounting Firm was located.\nHowever, I wasn't focused on his story\u2014I was lost in thought.\n'Is Mr. Ferrer related to Angelo? Angelo's last name is also Ferrer. I hope not... I'm not ready to see him again\u2026'\nI pushed aside my worries. There are many Ferrers in Elaraquinn\u2014it's just unlucky if that's the case.\nWhen we arrived on the 18th floor, I was about to ask Jason for Mr. Ferrer's first name when the office door suddenly opened. To my surprise, out came none other than my ex-boyfriend, Angelo Ferrer.\nI can't move from where I stand. It feels like everything from two years ago is coming rushing back. 'AF' stands for Angelo Ferrer?\n\u2018You're so silly, Jenna! Why didn't you think of that?' I scolded myself.\n\"Angelo, this is Ms. Jenna Smith. She's the one I was telling you about,\" said Jason as he introduced me to Angelo.\nAngelo stared at me intently, his eyes betraying a hint of pain.\n\nChapter 2\n\"H-Hello Mr. Ferrer,\" I said, extending my hand. He didn't accept my handshake.\nJason was shocked by Angelo's behavior.\n\"Ms. Smith, please come to my office. I want to talk to you in private,\" Angelo ordered and then abruptly turned around.\nI followed Angelo with my head down and knees trembling. I am not sure if I can make it to the office without collapsing.\nJason was left standing, confused by what was happening.\n\"Close the door, Ms. Smith,\" Angelo said, sitting in his swivel chair as if he owned the world.\nIn fairness, he looks even more handsome. His 1.82-meter height makes his striking face even more noticeable. Angelo used to be a varsity basketball player, so his physique is still very fit.\nAngelo and I were classmates at Ateneo, both pursuing a BS in Accountancy. I was the basketball team's cheerleader, and Angelo was the MVP. We were university sweethearts.\nSince our first year, Angelo had been protecting me, keeping other boys away. They were afraid of him since his family was on the university's board of trustees.\nMany girls liked him, but I was the lucky one who caught his attention. Well, he wasn't missing out with me either. Many said we were a perfect match\u2014a beautiful girl and a handsome guy.\n-\nNarrator's POV:\nJenna couldn't help but scrutinize her ex-boyfriend. He was still very handsome. 'I wonder how many abs he has under that shirt... If it weren't embarrassing, I might have hugged him. I admit, I miss him so much, but no, Jenna, control yourself. You left because he has a fianc\u00e9e, remember?'\nJenna shook her head to suppress her imagination.\n\"Ms. Smith,\" Angelo called, bringing her back to reality.\n\"So, Jenna, long time no see. How are you? Why are you here? Were you looking for me? Haven't you moved on from me yet?\" Angelo asked, pretending not to know that Jenna was coming. He had been restless, waiting for her arrival.\nJenna's ears burned at Angelo's words.\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Ferrer, but I didn't know you were here, and I didn't know you'd be my boss. For your information, I moved on from you a long time ago,\" Jenna lied to hide her embarrassment.\nHow could she move on when just looking at his body made her want to feast on it?\n\"Well, I don't just work here, Jenna. I'm the CEO of this company. And this building is mine,\" Angelo said.\nIf someone else had said that, Jenna would think they were bragging. But when Angelo said it, it sounded impressive.\n'Hush, Jenna, stop it. Angelo might notice,' Jenna scolded herself inwardly.\n\"Since I urgently need a secretary and you're the most qualified for the position, you're already hired,\" Angelo said, staring at her.\nJenna didn't know whether to be happy about what Angelo said.\n'What now, Jenna? Can you handle seeing him every day if you work here? Do you want to be hurt again?' she thought, feeling crazy for talking to herself.\n\"H-Hmm, I think there must be a mistake. I can't accept the job,\" Jenna stammered.\n\"Why? Oh, I get it. You're not over me yet?\" Angelo teased.\n'How arrogant! Am I that obvious? I need to regain my composure. I won't let you win, Angelo Ferrer,' she told herself.\n\"I'm so over you! After all, it's been two years. I went to Veloria after we broke up. What do you think I did there? Stay in a convent?\" Jenna said with her head held high. She didn't know why she said that, but she needed to hide her embarrassment and defend herself.\nShe seemed to have succeeded. Angelo's face darkened, and he gave her a sharp look. His eyes blazed as he stared at her as if he wanted to devour her.\n\"Accept the position if it's not a problem for you then. And to correct you, Ms. Smith, we didn't break up. You ran away without any explanation! You just assumed we were over.\"\n'Huh? What did he say?' Jenna thought, puzzled.\n\"What now, Jenna?\" Angelo asked, snapping her out of her thoughts.\n\"Are you going to leave and hide again as you did before?\" Angelo asked.\n'What is he talking about? I was the one who got hurt, right? I was the one who got cheated on, right?' Jenna wanted to shout and make Angelo understand what she was thinking.\n\"Okay! I'll accept your offer!\" Jenna blurted out.\nShe was stunned. 'What did I just say?!'\nEven she was surprised by what she said. Her heart must have spoken, not her mind. Her traitorous heart betrayed her!\n\"Okay, good. You may start tomorrow. You can leave now, Ms. Smith. See you tomorrow,\" Angelo said, turning his swivel chair around, not giving her a chance to take back what she said.\n'Rude! What have I gotten myself into? Help me, God. There's no turning back now. Whatever happens, happens.' Jenna thought.\nAngelo ended their conversation abruptly, leaving Jenna no opportunity to reconsider.\n\n'God, I missed her so much,' he thought, closing his eyes.\nHe didn't think he could handle seeing her again today. He had been restless since last night, thinking he was ready. He had been under the impression he had moved on and wouldn't be hurt.\nBut he was wrong\u2014so many wrong assumptions. He wasn't ready at all.\n'What have you gotten yourself into, Angelo?'\n\n-\nLast night, at the club:\nAngelo was with his friends. Jason and Miguel Alvarez were already seated when he arrived, and as usual, Inigo Malone was late.\n\"How's your secretary, bro? I heard he's in critical condition,\" Miguel asked.\nAngelo's secretary had been hit by a truck and was in the hospital recovering.\n\"He's fine. But it will take a while for him to recover. He won't be back at work for some time,\" Angelo replied.\n\"So you're without a secretary now? That's tough, bro, with all your businesses. You need an assistant,\" Inigo said.\nAngelo sighed.\n\"I can help you find a temporary secretary, bro. I have a friend who's perfect for the position. Actually, she's not looking for a job. She's just here for a vacation. She's a model in Veloria.\"\n\"Hmmm, sounds interesting!\" Inigo responded with a grin.\n\"I don't want a female secretary!\" Angelo interjected.\nHis friends laughed. He didn't want to mix work with complications. Every female secretary he had had, had tried to seduce him. His friends knew that he hadn't gotten over his ex-girlfriend, so he had no social life. Women were forbidden on their nights out if Angelo was around. They said he was boring to hang out with.\n\"Are you sure about that?\" Jason asked, pulling out his phone and showing Angelo a picture.\n\"Owww!\" his friends exclaimed in unison.\nAngelo was stunned. The woman in the picture was none other than his first love and heartbreak, Jenna Smith. He fell silent.\nAngelo had spent years immersing himself in work to forget Jenna. He had started his own company, fulfilling the dream they had shared after graduating from university. He didn't want to rely on a position his father would offer in the family business. Now, he found himself both confused and hopeful about seeing Jenna again. She was back.\n\"What? Cat got your tongue, bro? If you don't want her, I'll take her. I'll fire my secretary right away,\" Miguel joked.\nAngelo gave him a sharp look. He didn't mention that he knew the woman in the picture.\n\"So, what makes you think she'll take the job if she's not looking for one?\" Angelo asked Jason.\n\"Leave it to me. I've got this,\" Jason said with a grin.\nAngelo suddenly felt a pang of jealousy. He didn't show it, but he felt like ending Jason. Just thinking about another man in Jenna's life made him furious.\n\"Tell her to come to my office tomorrow morning,\" Angelo said.\nHis friends laughed heartily at his command.\n\"So, you're giving in, huh? Looks like Mr. Grumpy fell in love,\" his friends teased.\n\"Shut up, guys!\" Angelo said, making them laugh even harder.\nHe sighed. His friends knew exactly how to annoy him.\n-\nAngelo went home but still couldn't calm down about seeing Jenna the next day. Lying in bed and staring at the ceiling, he recalled their passionate moments.\n-\nBack then.\n\"Babe, come over to the condo after your class. I miss you so much,\" Angelo said sweetly over the phone.\n\"Okay, babe. I'll just finish my assignment. I'll be there by 6:00 pm,\" Jenna replied.\nJason grinned, thinking about what he would do to his girlfriend. He missed her so much, even though they saw each other every day. They never got tired of each other.\nJenna arrived at 6:30 p.m., delayed by her assignments.\n\"Hi, babe,\" she greeted, but before she could say more, Angelo kissed her.\n\"I missed you,\" he whispered in her ear, teasing her. His hands roamed her body.\n\"Stop it, babe. Someone might see us,\" Jenna protested.\n\"No one will see us...\"\n\"Let's have dinner, babe. I'm hungry,\" Jenna tried to change the subject, knowing Angelo's plan. \n\"Later, babe. I have something to do for you. This hard thing here misses you,\" Angelo said with a grin.\nJenna laughed at his words.\nThey quickly entered Angelo's unit. He wasted no time, kissing Jenna passionately.\nJenna held onto his neck.\n\"Oh, babe!\" She gasped as his hands explored her body. He went straight to her sweet spot, teasing her until she was breathless.\n\"God, you're so wet, baby,\" Angelo said.\nShe was soaking wet, and Angelo knelt, lifting her skirt.\nJenna was lost in pleasure.\n\"You're so ready for me, babe, dripping wet,\" he said with a grin, making her blush.\n\"Oh, ah, please don't stop, babe,\" Jenna pleaded, barely able to stand.\nAngelo smiled at her words, increasing his efforts. He inserted a finger, playing inside her while kissing her.\n\"Ohhh, babe!\" Jenna cried. \"I want you inside me... Babe, please,\" she begged.\nAngelo stood up and granted her wish, bending her over the table for support.\n\"I don't just do it, babe. I do it hard. Are you ready?\" he asked.\n\"Yes,\" Jenna answered.\nAngelo aimed his thing at Jenna's entrance and forcefully thrust it in without warning.\nJenna gasped at the pleasure her boyfriend was giving her. Angelo's movements quickened, his thrusts becoming more intense.\n\"Ahhhhh, ohhhhh, aahhhhh... I love you so much, babe. I will never hurt you,\" Angelo whispered as he pleasured his girlfriend.\nLuckily, the table Jenna was holding onto was sturdy, or it might have collapsed under the force and speed of Angelo's thrusts.\nJenna was utterly overwhelmed, not knowing where to turn her head from the intense pleasure. \n\"I'm coming, baaabee. Please don't stop,\" Jenna cried out.\n\"Come with me, Jenna,\" Angelo urged, thrusting deeply until they climaxed together.\nJenna collapsed onto the table, both of them catching their breath.\n\"I love you so much, babe,\" Angelo whispered in Jenna's ear.\n\"I love you too, babe,\" Jenna replied, her voice barely audible from exhaustion.\n\nChapter 3\nAngelo snapped back to the present from his memories of Jenna.\n\"Gosh.\" His pants were tented, and he was painfully aroused. He headed to the bathroom to take a cold shower and cool off.\nIt had been two years, but Jenna still had the same effect on him.\n\"You witch, Jenna, what did you do to me? Why can't I forget you?\" he asked himself.\nJenna had left him without any explanation, without giving him a chance to explain. Now, he planned to turn the tables. He would make her fall for him again and then leave her just like she had done to him.\n\"Be ready, Jenna Smith. I'll make your life miserable.\"\n-\nJenna had just arrived home.\n\"How was your interview, honey?\" her mom, Cathy Baker, asked.\n\"I'll start my work tomorrow, Mom,\" Jenna replied. \nShe didn't mention that Angelo would be her boss. Cathy might not let her go back if she knew.\n\"That's good to hear. Does this mean you won't return to Veloria?\"\n\"We'll see, Mom,\" Jenna answered.\nJenna lay in bed, feeling melancholic. After all these years, Angelo still had the same effect on her. She teared up, not expecting to see him again. She wasn't ready. The two years she had spent in Veloria trying to heal were wasted\u2014it still hurt.\nJenna looked at her wrist, where the scar was still visible. She touched it, remembering the pain of the past. She fell asleep with tears in her eyes.\n\n-\nTwo years ago.\n\"Babe, I can't pick you up. We have a party at the court,\" Angelo told Jenna over the phone. His basketball team had won, and as usual, he was the MVP. \"Come after your class.\"\n\"Okay, babe, I'll be there. Congratulations! I love you, bye.\"\n\"I love you more,\" Angelo replied before hanging up.\nJenna was thrilled by his words.\nAfter hanging up, Angelo continued celebrating with his teammates when someone called his name. Celine Gobble, a family friend from America, ran excitedly toward him.\nAngelo didn't know she had arrived. Celine was the girl his father, Marco Ferrer, wanted him to marry, but he saw her only as a sister. His parents didn't know about Jenna because he had been living in a condo near their school since university.\nCeline's family was as wealthy as his, which made her appealing to his father.\nCeline was three years younger and the same age as Luke. The latter had always had a crush on Celine, but Celine liked Angelo, probably due to their parents' influence.\n\"Hey, Angelo, congratulations!\" Celine hugged and kissed him in front of everyone, catching him off guard.\nAs they stood there, a sudden noise made Angelo look up. He saw Jenna, with her friends, Felice Lopez and Sarah Taylor, holding a \"Congratulations\" cake.\nJenna dropped the cake and ran out of the court crying.\nAngelo tried to follow, but Celine stopped him.\n\"Who's that girl?\" Celine asked.\n\"My girlfriend,\" Angelo replied.\n\"What?! How come you have a girlfriend? I'm your fianc\u00e9e, Angelo!\" Celine exclaimed.\nAngelo ignored her and ran after Jenna, but she was gone. He tried calling her, but her phone was off. Dejected, he returned to the court, seeing Celine arguing with Luke.\nAngelo ignored them, focusing instead on Jenna. He needed to explain what had happened. He didn't want her to be hurt\u2014he loved her and didn't want to lose her.\n-\nFor three days, Angelo couldn't reach Jenna. She was avoiding him. He went to her house, but Cathy said she wasn't there and seemed unaware of the situation. Jenna's friends didn't know where she was either.\n-\n\"Jenna, what's your plan? You're wasting away!\" Abby said.\nJenna was staying with Abby to avoid Angelo, knowing he would come to her house to explain. But what was there to explain? She had seen him kissing another girl in front of everyone!\n\"I'm going back to Veloria in two weeks. Want to come with me? Instead of moping around, you can hide there if you don't want to talk to Angelo. Maybe it's time to pursue your dream of becoming a model, like me? You idolize me, right?\" Abby teased.\nAbby was a model in Veloria and had long tried to recruit Jenna, who had resisted because she wanted to finish school first.\n\"Okay, I'll think about it,\" Jenna replied.\n-\n\"Girl, how are you? Where are you?\" Sarah asked over the phone.\nJenna had ignored several calls but finally answered.\n\"I'm fine,\" she said.\n\"Angelo's been looking for you. We don't know where you are.\"\nNo one knew where Jenna was. She hadn't told anyone, knowing Angelo would get the truth out of them. Jenna had been in Ventus for three days. Her cousin Abby had a beach house there, having just arrived from Veloria for a three-week vacation.\nAngelo didn't know Abby because she lived in Veloria. Abby had accompanied Jenna to the beach house, where Jenna had spent days crying and unwashed, wanting to die. She couldn't believe Angelo had done that to her\u2014her chest ached with pain.\nJenna realized Sarah was still talking.\n\"Girl, are you still there? There's a rumor at school that Angelo has been engaged to that witch he was kissing.\"\nJenna's heart shattered at Sarah's words, and she started crying again. She didn't think she had any tears left. She clutched her chest, unable to breathe from the pain.\nSarah heard her sobs and started crying too, hating to see Jenna hurt. \"Sorry, Jenna.\"\n\"Where are you? Felice and I will come to you,\" Sarah asked.\n\"Don't bother, Sarah,\" Jenna replied. \"You might just get caught up in this mess with Angelo. You know he won't stop until he finds me. It's better if you don't know where I am.\"\n\"Just take care of yourself. Don't do anything drastic... Your beauty would be wasted,\" Sarah joked, trying to lighten the mood.\nJenna managed a small laugh at her friend's attempt to cheer her up. Sarah then excused herself, saying she had a class.\nSarah's words gave Jenna an idea. Maybe it would be better if she just ended it all. Her life was meaningless without Angelo, who had betrayed her.\n\"I can't take this pain anymore,\" she whispered.\nSobbing, she stood up and went to the kitchen. She saw a knife and slowly cut her wrist. Blood started to flow, but she felt no physical pain\u2014her heartache was worse.\nAs blood pooled around her, Abby found her.\n\"Jenna, what are you doing?!\" Abby screamed, running over to grab the knife.\nJenna collapsed, pale from blood loss.\n\"Abby,\" she whispered, tears streaming down her face before she lost consciousness.\n\"Jenna, wake up! Wake up!\" Abby cried desperately.\n-\nWhen Jenna woke up, she saw only white. Her head hurt, and she remembered cutting her wrist.\n'Am I in heaven?' she wondered.\nLooking around, she saw her mom sleeping on a sofa. Realizing she wasn't dead, she understood she was in a hospital.\nCathy woke up upon sensing Jenna was awake and rushed to her side, crying. \"Thank goodness you're awake! How are you feeling?\"\nCathy told her she had been in a coma for two days due to extreme stress and blood loss.\n\"What day is it?\" Jenna asked.\nCathy told her, and she started to cry again\u2014it was supposed to be her graduation day.\n\"Don't cry, dear. It won't help you. Try to rest,\" Cathy gently encouraged her.\nJenna closed her eyes, tears rolling down her cheeks.\n-\nAfter discussing with Abby, Jenna decided to go to Veloria once she was out of the hospital. The pain Angelo had caused was too much. They had been together for four years, and she never knew he had a fianc\u00e9e. She felt like a fool for giving him everything.\n'I believed he loved me,' she thought tearfully. 'From now on, I won't shed another tear for you, Angelo Ferrer. Mark my words!'\nCathy looked at her with deep sympathy, feeling her daughter's pain.\n\n-\nAt AF.\n\"Ms. Smith, come to my office now,\" Angelo commanded as Jenna arrived at the office.\nAngelo sat in his swivel chair. \"What's my schedule for today?\"\n\"You have a lunch meeting with Ms. Celine Gobble at noon,\" Jenna replied, checking her tablet for other details.\nWhen she looked up, she saw Angelo staring at her. Their eyes met, and neither wanted to break the silence.\n\"Ah, excuse me, sir. Ms. Celine Gobble is here,\" a staff member interrupted, knocking on the door.\nThe door opened, and a tall, beautiful woman walked in.\n\"Hi, babe, ready for lunch?\" Celine said, making Jenna's heart sink.\n'Babe?' Jenna thought. 'Is that what they call each other? How unoriginal.'\nAngelo glanced at Jenna before responding to Celine. \"Yes, I'm ready. Shall we go?\"\nCeline looked Jenna up and down before focusing on Angelo.\n\"Sure, babe,\" Celine replied, linking her arm with Angelo's.\nJenna scowled as she watched them leave.\n\"That's the woman Angelo kissed two years ago! So they're still together\u2026 He really did cheat on me!\" Jenna seethed.\nA knock on her office door brought her back from her painful memories.\n\"Jenna, is that you?\" asked a handsome man who walked in. It was Luke, Angelo's brother.\nJenna smiled and stood up to greet him with a kiss on the cheek. \"Yes, Luke, it's me!\"\n\"What brings you here? Are you and my brother back together?\" Luke asked with a grin.\n\"No, I work here now. It's my first day,\" Jenna replied, shaking her head.\nLuke looked puzzled. \"Why here? I heard you were already a successful model in Veloria.\"\n\"I wanted to practice what I studied. If it doesn't work out, I'll go back to Veloria,\" Jenna explained.\n\"So you're leaving again?\" A voice echoed from behind them. It was Angelo. Neither Jenna nor Luke had noticed him enter.\nAngelo had returned to retrieve his forgotten phone. He approached Jenna, glaring at her.\n\"Hey, Angelo, you didn't tell me your first love works here,\" Luke teased.\n\"Shut up, Luke!\" Angelo snapped.\nJenna stood in stunned silence at Luke's words.\n\"So, Jenna, are you leaving again?\" Angelo barked.\nJenna felt uneasy. \"I don't know. My parents don't want me to leave, but they won't stop me if that's what I decide.\"\nAngelo's eyes blazed with anger.\n\"Luke, let's have lunch. My treat,\" Jenna interrupted, trying to change the subject.\n\"Sure, let's go!\"`Luke agreed, and they left the office together.\n\nChapter 4\nAngelo stood frozen as Jenna and Luke walked away.\nJenna had just returned, but it already felt like she was planning to leave again. He hadn't even begun his plan to make her fall for him once more, only to abandon her as she had done to him two years ago.\n-\nIn a restaurant.\nWhile having lunch, Jenna asked Luke about Celine. \"H-Hmm Luke, is it true that Celine is Angelo's fianc\u00e9e?\"\n\"Yes, Jenna. That's what our parents want, but I'm against it. I like Celine, but she prefers my brother,\" Luke revealed with a laugh. \"I know Celine doesn't love Angelo like that. He's more like a brother to her. She's possessive of him because he always indulges her. She's an only child, and my brother and I give her all the attention she craves.\"\n\"Why doesn't she like you if you like her?\" Jenna asked, curious.\n\"She said we're both too childish. She prefers Angelo because he's more mature. But Angelo never dated her. He hasn't moved on from his first love,\" Luke said with a wink at Jenna.\n\"But now that you're back, Angelo will be too distracted to give Celine any attention. Don't worry. I'll take care of Celine. You can have your first love back,\" Luke teased.\nJenna pretended not to hear the last part.\n\"Let's go. Angelo might be looking for me,\" she said, changing the subject.\n\"Kiss him if he scolds you. I'm sure he'll melt,\" Luke joked, making Jenna laugh.\n\"You're silly!\" Jenna said with a smile.\n-\nWhen Jenna returned to the office, Angelo called her through the intercom.\n\"Come in!\" he said.\nHe watched her approach.\n\"Yes, sir. Do you need anything?\" Jenna asked.\n\"You\u2026 I need you, Jenna,\" Angelo replied, his gaze intense.\n\"What?\" Jenna thought, 'Why did that sound like it has a double meaning?'\nAngelo stood up and moved closer to her.\nJenna stepped back, feeling uneasy with his proximity. She feared she might hug him if he got any closer.\n\"Scared, Jenna?\" Angelo asked.\n\"N-No\u2026 Why would I be?\" she stammered.\n\"Good,\" Angelo replied simply.\n\"I have a party with a client tonight. Come with me,\" he instructed.\nJenna began to protest, \"But, sir\u2014\"\n\"No buts,\" Angelo interrupted. \"Wear something nice. I'll pick you up at 8:00 p.m.\"\nJenna didn't want to go, fearing her heart might betray her again. She didn't want Angelo to know she still had feelings for him.\nAngelo moved closer until there was no space between them. He tilted her chin up as if to kiss her.\nJenna closed her eyes, waiting for his lips to touch hers.\n\"You may go, Jenna.\" Angelo's words caused her to snap her eyes open. Had she just imagined he was going to kiss her? How embarrassing!\n\"Okay, sir,\" she replied, quickly leaving the room.\nJenna headed to the restroom to catch her breath. She felt suffocated, overwhelmed by Angelo's closeness. She couldn't deny she still loved him, but Angelo mustn't know. Their relationship was long over, and he was engaged.\nTears filled her eyes as her thoughts raced.\n'Stop it, Jenna,' she scolded herself.\n-\n'I couldn't help but get close to Jenna. I wanted to touch her, kiss her, and cover her with kisses until she was weak in my arms. God, I missed her so much! She's even more beautiful now. If she was charming before, now she's perfect. She's more mature, her laughter is like music, and she moves with such grace,' Angelo thought.\nAngelo closed his eyes, lost in thought. Unbeknownst to Jenna, he had been watching her from a distance since she started working in his office. He felt like a stalker, unable to take his eyes off her.\n\"Jenna\u2026 My Jenna.\"\nShe had become a famous model in Veloria, and Angelo was proud of her achievements. They had shared the same university course, but she hadn't taken the board exams because she left for Veloria to escape him. He smirked at the memory of their past.\n\n-\nTwo years ago.\nAngelo searched everywhere for Jenna, interrogating classmates and acquaintances, but no one knew where she was.\n\"Never mind, graduation is in less than a week... I'll see her there. I need to explain everything about Celine. I can't lose Jenna. I love her so much.\"\n-\nGraduation day came, but Jenna didn't attend.\nAngelo found out she had gone to Veloria. The pain was excruciating.\nWhy did she leave without hearing his side? Was she just giving up that easily, handing him over to Celine?\n-\n'You're so weak, Jenna. You left me,' Angelo thought bitterly and smiled wryly as he recalled the past.\n-\nThat evening, at exactly 8:00 p.m., Angelo picked Jenna up from her house for the party.\nHe was awestruck by her beauty as she approached him, looking like a goddess in her white cocktail dress. The dress had a plunging neckline that revealed her perfect shape and was knee-length, hugging her curves. A long slit on the right side of the dress made it both inviting and tantalizing.\n'Oh, I miss kissing her there... I miss the feeling of being inside her tight\u2026' he thought, feeling his pants tighten as Jenna drew near.\n'Relax, Angelo,' he told himself.\n'Just wait. Tonight she will be mine again,' he promised himself.\nJenna felt uncomfortable under Angelo's intense gaze. Was she overdressed?\n\"H-Hi, sir,\" Jenna greeted as she got into the car. She noticed Angelo looked momentarily flustered but quickly regained his composure, nodding slightly and waiting for her to settle in.\nThey didn't speak during the drive.\nAngelo noticed from the corner of his eye that Jenna was rubbing her wrist, where a long scar was visible.\n'What happened to her? How did she get that scar?' Angelo wondered.\n-\nAt the venue, Angelo got out first and opened the door for Jenna.\n\"Stay close to me. I don't want other guys to get near you. That dress is a sin,\" Angelo whispered, his breath tickling her ear.\nJenna felt uneasy.\n'Did he do that on purpose?\n'Shh, Jenna, focus! You're here for work. Don't be silly... As if Angelo still wants you. He has Celine now,' she thought, composing herself as she walked alongside Angelo.\nShe saw Luke and Celine talking in the garden, seemingly arguing. She decided to leave them be.\n-\n\"Where's Angelo?\" Celine asked Luke.\n\"Why are you looking for Angelo when I'm here?\" Luke teased, trying to annoy her.\n\"I want to be with my bro, not you!\" Celine retorted.\nCeline was quite strange. She called Angelo \"Babe\" in front of others but \"Bro\" when they were alone. Only the three of them knew this. Everyone else thought she was Angelo's fianc\u00e9e. \nCeline was possessive, not wanting any other woman to get Angelo's attention, spoiled by his indulgence. This possessiveness was why Angelo and Jenna had broken up. Jenna had seen Celine kiss Angelo on the court, and rumors had spread that she was his fianc\u00e9e.\n-\nBack then.\nLuke had scolded Celine, \"Why did you do that, Celine? Angelo has a girlfriend!\"\nCeline pouted. \"So what?\"\nLuke snapped, \"You're such a brat!\"\nIn truth, Luke had feelings for Celine for a long time. They were the same age, but she didn't like him because she thought they were both childish and bratty.\nHe shook his head, frustrated.\n'What do you want me to do, Celine, to make you love me?' Luke wondered silently.\n\nChapter 5\nAngelo saw Jason, Miguel, and Inigo on the other side. He steered Jenna in a different direction, hoping to avoid them. He was afraid they would tease Jenna.\nUnfortunately, it was too late\u2014Jason spotted them and quickly approached.\n\"Oh, hi there, doll,\" Jason greeted Jenna with a kiss.\nMiguel and Inigo followed behind Jason.\nJenna smiled sweetly at Jason and hugged him tightly. \"Hi, hunk!\"\nShe nestled into Jason's arms, resting her head on his shoulder. They were so affectionate together.\nAngelo gritted his teeth, feeling a surge of jealousy.\n\"So this is the gorgeous model from Veloria you've been talking about?\" Inigo and Miguel asked Jason.\n\"Hi, I'm Inigo Malone,\" Inigo introduced himself, shaking hands with Jenna and giving her a kiss.\n\"Hi, I'm Miguel Alvarez.\" Miguel kissed her as well.\n\"I'm Jenna Smith,\" she introduced herself with a smile.\n\"Stop it, guys. She's mine!\" Angelo snapped, frustrated with his friends' flirtation.\n\"Yours? What do you mean, yours?\" Jason teased.\n\"Ah, I mean she's with me. So back off!\" Angelo retorted.\nAngelo tried to assert himself, but his friends just laughed it off, ignoring him. He wanted to punch them!\nCeline and Luke approached their group.\n\"Jenna, this is Celine,\" Luke introduced them.\nCeline glanced at Jenna dismissively, then turned her attention to Angelo. \"Babe, why didn't you come to pick me up?\"\n\"Luke did, didn't he? He's your date, not me,\" Angelo replied, annoyed.\n\"But I don't like him. He always bullies me!\" Celine complained.\n\"Why don't you like me, huh? Am I not handsome enough for you? I could kiss you right now,\" Luke teased.\n\"Yuck!\" Celine said.\n\"Stop it, Luke. Don't tease Celine,\" Angelo defended her.\nJenna suddenly felt a pang of jealousy.\nA passing waiter with a glass of wine caught Jenna's eye, and she grabbed it and took a sip, surprising everyone.\n\"Wow, Jenna's pretty cool,\" Inigo remarked, and everyone chuckled\u2014except Angelo, who watched Jenna with a stern gaze.\nDespite his feelings, Angelo enjoyed the company of his friends.\nCeline and Luke drifted away, caught up in their debate once more.\nJenna was glad to meet new friends and found herself enjoying their company. She seemed to be having a good time, although she had had a bit too much to drink and was becoming quite talkative. Her laugh had changed.\nAngelo suddenly grabbed her from where he stood.\nJenna pressed against his chest, feeling a jolt of electricity as their bodies touched.\n\"Let's go, Jenna,\" Angelo said firmly.\n\"But why? The night is still young,\" Jason protested.\n\"She's tipsy. She's my responsibility at work tomorrow. She can't afford to be absent,\" he lied to his friends.\n\"Luke, you're in charge of Celine. Drive her home,\" he ordered his brother.\nJenna noticed Celine's envious look. It was clear she felt well taken care of by Angelo.\nAngelo led Jenna to the parking lot where his car was parked. As they got in, Jenna suddenly kissed him, catching him by surprise.\n\"Babe, what does Celine have that I don't? And why do you both call each other 'babe'? Don't you have any originality?\" Jenna asked tearfully.\nShe was drunk and saying things Angelo could barely understand. He just let it be.\n'She can't go home like this... What would her mother say if she saw me bringing Jenna home? She might distance herself from me again,' Angelo thought.\nThey headed straight to his condo. He carried Jenna into his unit and laid her on the bed. He was about to leave when Jenna held him.\n\n\"Babe, I missed you,\" she said, kissing him. \"I know you miss me too!\"\nAngelo knew she wasn't thinking straight. She had a low wine tolerance and got drunk quickly.\n\"My body misses you, babe. Only you can make me feel this good,\" she said.\nHearing this, Angelo kissed Jenna passionately, as if they were running out of air.\n\"Ahhh\u2026 Oh, babe...\" Jenna moaned.\nAngelo released her for a moment to adjust her position, but she started taking off clothes as if she were feeling hot.\nHer body was now exposed. He eagerly took them in his mouth, switching between them and making Jenna squirm.\n'I missed this woman so much,' Angelo thought.\nJenna was the only one who could satisfy him like this. He pulled down Jenna's underwear and slid a finger inside her.\n\"Ahhhh...\" Jenna arched her back.\nHe had waited so long to do this to Jenna again.\nHis finger felt hot inside her.\nAngelo, overwhelmed by the sensations, didn't know what to do. He was so excited he couldn't take it any longer.\nJenna yelled as he entered her.\n\"God, Jenna, you're so tight. I missed your folds!\" Angelo whispered.\n\"Ahhh! Babe, do me hard please!\" Jenna begged.\nHe positioned her on all fours and pounded away.\nJenna gripped the edge of the bed, seeking strength.\n\"Babe, I'm coming\u2026 Don't stop... Don't stop! Ahhh!\"\nAngelo collapsed on top of her, both of them exhausted. He noticed Jenna had fallen asleep, likely due to the wine. He smiled as her head rested on his arm and gazed at her with love. If she hadn't left before, he might have married her, and they could have had kids by now.\nHe chuckled, remembering Jenna's words just now. Would she remember them? He'd find out when she woke up.\nA big smile spread across his face as he recalled her declaration of love. He had proven that she still loved him, that he still owned her heart and body.\nAngelo caressed Jenna's face, fixing her hair. She was really beautiful. He would never tire of having her.\nHe needed to find a way to keep her from leaving again. The thought of her abandoning him once more terrified him. He couldn't handle that a second time.\nHe kissed her forehead.\n\"Sleep well, babe,\" he whispered.\nAngelo soon fell asleep with a smile on his lips.\n-\nJenna sat up in bed. \"Was I dreaming again?\"\nHer head hurt as she tried to remember last night. Why did it feel so real? Why was her body sore?\nShe looked around\u2014this wasn't her room!\nShe was shocked to see Angelo lying next to her. She peeked under the blanket covering her.\nAngelo woke up from her sudden movement.\n\"Oh, good morning, babe,\" he greeted with a smile, wrapping his arm around her waist.\nHer ears rang! She slapped Angelo!\n\"What babe? I'm not Celine!\"\nAngelo was stunned by the slap. He held his cheek, confused by what Jenna had said. Did she think he had mistaken her for Celine because he called her \"babe\"?\nShe was the one calling him \"babe\" all night while he had been pounding her\u2026\nAngelo smirked at the thought.\nHe wouldn't correct Jenna's misconception. This was the perfect time to execute his plan to hurt her. He'd let her believe he had a relationship with Celine and make her die of jealousy. He knew she still loved him because of her revelations last night.\nHe laughed suddenly. 'Apparently, wine is all it takes.'\nJenna got up from the bed, but Angelo pulled her back.\n\"Did you enjoy what we did last night, Jenna?\"\nJenna blushed at Angelo's question. She couldn't deny she still loved him\u2026\nIn the end, she didn't answer.\n\"Don't bother answering... I know I'm still the one who makes you happy, the one your body craves. No other man can do that, and I won't let anyone else try. You're mine, Jenna Smith!\" he whispered in her ear, scolding her like a child.\nAngelo sat up straight, giving them some space so Jenna could be comfortable. She seemed too ashamed to move because he could read her heart and mind. This was his chance.\n\"I have a proposition,\" Angelo began. \"You can have me as long as you want. You can have my body if you're thirsty. You can use my body for your pleasure. But no strings attached. No feelings involved.\"\nJenna was shocked by what Angelo said. 'Is this real? Is my desire for him that obvious?'\nShe remained silent, unsure of what to say.\nAfter a while, Angelo touched her body and twirled his finger around it like a child playing. He didn't notice it was exposed. It was tempting him again.\n\"What do you think, Jenna?\" Angelo asked.\nShe remained silent.\nAngelo took Jenna's hand and placed it on his now hard thing.\n'Ahhh, whatever!' Jenna thought.\n\n-\nJenna finally made it home. When Cathy asked where she had spent the night, she casually said at a girlfriend's house.\nHer parents still didn't know that Angelo was her boss. If they found out, they might push her to go back to Veloria.\nJenna couldn't believe she had agreed to Angelo's proposal to be friends with benefits. Her former boyfriend was now her FUBU.\nNo strings attached, no feelings involved? Could she handle that?\nPerhaps this was all she could offer since he had Celine. Didn't Angelo even mistake Jenna for Celine after they slept?\nJenna was confused about her situation. Did Angelo see her as that cheap? She was annoyed with herself for drinking last night, knowing her low wine tolerance, and now she was in trouble again.\nIt pained her, but she realized this was the only way to get close to Angelo again. She couldn't deny that she still loved him.\nShe would think about the consequences later. For now, it was enough that she was happy with Angelo, even if it was \"no strings attached, no feelings involved.\"\nJenna sighed deeply.\nAngelo didn't let her go to work that day, telling her to rest. With nothing to do at home, she called Sarah and Felice and invited them to go shopping. She had only seen them twice since she returned from Veloria. Both were busy with their work: Sarah had an advertising agency, and Felice managed her family's chain of restaurants. She needed friends right now. She needed to talk about her situation with Angelo.\n-\nThey met at a popular coffee shop.\nJenna arrived first since she was free that day. Her two friends arrived together.\nNot to boast, but her friends were truly beautiful and could easily pass as models like her. At university, many people were envious of them when they were together. It always felt like a fashion show with all eyes on them.\nJenna laughed at the memory.\n\"What?! Jenna, are you out of your mind?\" Sarah and Felice exclaimed in unison.\n\"What's wrong with you, Jenna? Have you gone crazy? You're just putting yourself in danger. Didn't you almost die because of him?\"\nThey threatened, \"If you don't stop this, we're telling your parents!\"\n\"Girls, please... you know he's my greatest love, right? I can handle any consequences, as long as we're okay again. I also feel guilty about what I did to him before. I didn't fight for him against Celine. I let Celine take him from me.\"\n\"That's nonsense, Jenna. They were already engaged long before you came into the picture!\"\n\"Girls, please understand me. I didn't call you to condemn me. I need a friend right now.\"\nSarah and Felice looked at each other and sighed.\n\"Alright,\" Felice said. \"We'll let you be with your craziness. But if you can't handle it anymore, exit, okay? And don't do anything silly like cutting yourself!\"\nJenna laughed at her friends. They really loved each other.\n\n-\nThe next day, Jenna went to the office.\n\"Ms. Smith, come to my office,\" Angelo called her on the intercom.\nJenna entered and spotted Angelo sitting in his swivel chair.\n\"Come here,\" he said.\nJenna approached.\n\"Closer... Closer.\"\nShe was now standing in front of Angelo.\n\"What's my schedule for today?\" Angelo asked while stroking her leg.\nShe was wearing a short skirt, giving him easy access. Angelo inserted a finger inside her. The entire office was made of glass, but people outside couldn't see inside.\n\"Uhm, you have a meeting with Mr. Montero at 10:00 a.m. and a meeting with Mr. Lee at 3:00 p.m.\"\n\"That's all?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nAngelo suddenly pushed his whole finger inside her.\nJenna gasped at his action.\n\"Okay... You can go.\"\n\"Y-Yes, sir.\" She composed herself before leaving.\nAngelo grinned at what was happening. He used to be the one seduced by secretaries. Now, he was the one seducing his secretary. He used to say he wouldn't mix work with fooling around, but it looked like he was breaking his own rule. He chuckled, spinning in his swivel chair.\nJenna was surprised by what Angelo had done, but she liked it. Her body was becoming Angelo's slave. She didn't know if they could ever go back to their previous relationship, but even the little attention Angelo gave her made her happy. That was how much she loved him.\n\nChapter 6\nJenna really missed Angelo. Since he called her to his office earlier, he hadn't come out yet. He was busy with a conference meeting.\nIt was already 5:00 p.m. when Angelo finally emerged from his office, seeming in a bad mood. He didn't even glance at her as he passed by her office. He went straight to the elevator.\nWhat could have happened again?\nAngelo deliberately ignored Jenna as he passed by her office, wanting to make her miss him. He chuckled at his own mischief, surprised to find he still had some left in him.\nJenna was upset, packing her things to go home. She angrily stuffed her belongings into her bag. After flirting with her in his office, he didn't even acknowledge her now\u2014not even a glance. \n\"Hmph. He's so annoying!\"\nJenna\u2019s cell phone rang. Jason was calling her.\n\"Hi, Jason!\" she greeted her friend.\n\"How's my gorgeous best friend? Where are you?\" Jason asked.\n\"At the office.\"\n\"Can you treat me to dinner? I miss you,\" Jason teased.\n\"Okay, pick me up here. I'll wait for you,\" Jenna said with a smile.\n-\nAngelo was at a coffee shop in front of his office, waiting for Jenna to come out. He knew she was upset with him for not acknowledging her\u2014he just wanted to tease her. He planned to give her a ride home when she left the office.\nAfter a while, she came out of the building, but she was with Jason, her friend, who had his arm around her. They were laughing happily, and Angelo stiffened with jealousy.\nHe quickly left the coffee shop to intercept them.\n\"Where do you think you're going?\"\nJenna and Jason were surprised by the voice from behind them\u2014it was Angelo.\nJason greeted him, \"Hey, Angelo. You're still here? I thought you went home. I passed by your office.\"\n\"Exactly, you're here because I'm not, right?  Sneaking in while I'm away?\" Angelo retorted.\nJason was confused by Angelo's response. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\"Ahem, Jason, let's go,\" Jenna interrupted, afraid of what Angelo might do to Jason without him knowing.\n\"Okay, doll,\" Jason replied. \"You wanna come with us, bro? Jenna's treating me to dinner!\"\n\"I can buy my own dinner,\" Angelo replied curtly.\n'Hmm... Smells fishy,' Jason thought. 'Is he jealous? This is fun!'\nJason wanted to tease Angelo even more.\nHe held Jenna's hand, and she didn't resist as they often did this.\nJason noticed Angelo seething with anger. He leaned Jenna's head against his chest.\n\"You must be hungry. Let's go, doll,\" Jason invited Jenna.\n\"Angelo, we'll go ahead since you don't want to come... My date is hungry,\" Jenna teased with a laugh.\nJason was thoroughly enjoying teasing Angelo. 'This jealousy thing is interesting. Angelo seems like he could murder someone.'\nJason quickly got into his car, not wanting to get in trouble. He revved up the car engine, laughing loudly.\nJenna sat quietly in the passenger seat.\n\"Explain, doll.\"\n\"Explain what?\" Jenna replied.\n\"Explain why Angelo is acting like that. Is there something going on between you and him?\"\nJenna looked down, feeling embarrassed to admit it to Jason.\n\"He's my ex... The one I'm talking about,\" Jenna confessed.\n\"What?! Your university ex-boyfriend? Your first heartbreak?! Is that why you went to Veloria?\"\n\"Y-Yes.\"\n\"Ohh\u2026\" Jason responded shortly, processing Jenna's revelation. \"That nerdy guy is really lucky. Who would've thought you were his girlfriend? No wonder he's head over heels for you! Haha!\n\"Sorry, doll, I didn't know you had a history with Angelo. If I knew, I wouldn't have teased you there. That's why his reaction was so weird when he saw your picture, hahaha. Now I understand.\"\n\"What picture?\" Jenna asked.\n\"Never mind,\" Jason quickly replied. He was still friends with Angelo and didn't want to spill the beans.\n\"Do you know he's engaged to Celine?\" Jason asked.\n\"Y-Yes.\"\n\"So, what are you doing? Are you a masochist? You know they're getting married.\"\n\"I still love him, hunk... You know our story, right?\"\n\"Hmm, you want me to help you get back together? Let's make Angelo jealous! Hahaha! Let's pretend I'm courting you.\"\n\"I feel bad involving you in this, hunk. You shouldn't get caught up in our mess.\"\n\"Don't worry, doll... I volunteered myself. If it were someone else, I'd charge a talent fee. But for you, it's free, hahaha.\"\n-\nLuke picked up Celine from her university. She was graduating from her Fashion Design course. \nHe waited for her in the parking lot, amused by the students who stared at him and whispered excitedly. He was used to the attention and couldn't blame the girls\u2014he was incredibly handsome. He just smiled.\n\"Hi, love.\" He kissed Celine on the cheek when she arrived.\n\"Don't call me 'love'! We're not in a relationship!\"\n\"Not yet,\" Luke replied cheekily.\n\"I don't like womanizers. I want someone like Angelo, a 'Stick to One' type of guy!\"\n\"Ouch! Are you comparing me to Angelo? I can give you all the attention you want. Just love me back, Celine...\"\nSuddenly, a seducing student passed by and flirted with Luke. He smiled back at her.\n\"See! You just said it, but you're already flirting with someone else?!\" Celine punched him in the chest.\nLuke chuckled and gently caught her hand to stop her.\n\"What can I do, love? Your future boyfriend is so handsome. You should be proud that you're my choice. Many want to get my sweet 'yes'.\"\nLuke looked at her with love in his eyes. He lowered his head as if about to kiss her on the lips. \nCeline was startled and quickly pulled away from Luke.\n\"Hmph!\" She pretended to be annoyed, crossing her arms, but deep inside, she was thrilled with their situation. She also liked Luke and just wanted to make things a bit difficult for him. She was afraid his ego might grow if he knew she had a crush on him.\nLuke was handsome and seemed to have no worries in the world. He was easygoing and about to graduate from the Business Management course.\nAngelo and Luke came from a family with many businesses. As the only girl in the family, Celine was spoiled by them. Her father expected her to marry Angelo in due time to merge their businesses.\nAlthough she was engaged to Angelo, she saw him only as a brother, and Angelo felt the same way about her. She didn't understand why their families couldn't see that there was no romantic relationship between them. In truth, she liked Luke.\nMaybe it was because Angelo was the eldest. They expected him to marry first.\nCeline wouldn't fix the situation right now. If she was ready to accept Luke, she would tell their parents that she wanted to marry him, not Angelo.\nIn truth, she had done something terrible to Angelo. Jenna had left him because she had seen him kissing another girl.\nShe was young back then. How could she have known?\nLuke had scolded her at the time, and Angelo hadn't looked at her for months.\n-\nTwo years ago.\n\"Angelo, I am sorry! I didn't know you had a girlfriend. I just wanted to tease you.\"\n\"That's it! You're such a spoiled brat that you think the world revolves around you,\" Luke retorted.\n\"I already said sorry, right? Don't interfere in this! You're just jealous because I didn't kiss you! Hmph!\"\n\"Why would I be jealous? I don't even like you.\" Luke replied.\n\"That's enough!\" Angelo intervened. \"You two are acting like children. You're not helping.\u201d\n\n\"I'll leave our situation to destiny, Jenna,\" Angelo sadly said.\n\"Ewww! So cheesy!\" Luke chimed in, and they laughed together.\n\"I said enough, both of you! Get out!\"\n-\n\nIt had been three days, and Angelo still hadn't shown up. Was this his way of making Jenna miss him?\n\nAngelo hadn't come to the office. He said he was busy with their other business. He also hadn't called her.\n\nJenna really missed him. She didn't want to initiate a conversation. She decided to wait until they saw each other at the office.\n\nJenna was arranging her things when Angelo suddenly arrived.\n\n\"Ms. Smith, come to my office now.\"\n\nShe followed him.\n\n\"Close the door,\" he ordered, already seated in his swivel chair.\n\n\"Come here,\" he said as if she had become a robot, obedient to Angelo's commands.\n\nJenna approached him.\n\n\"Did you miss me, babe?\"\n\nShe grimaced. Was it her or Celine that he missed?\n\nHe held her by the waist and kissed her on her stomach. Jenna was again affected by Angelo's actions. He was enticing her.\n\n\"Do you feel what I feel, Jenna, hmm?\"\n\nHe held her hand and placed it on his hard thing. \"Can you free him? Unzip me, babe, please...\"\n\nJenna did as Angelo commanded. She was very aroused as she caressed it.\n\nShe looked at Angelo in the eyes, begging, \"Can you make me happy?\"\n\nShe knelt to position herself properly\u2026 and lovingly swallowed Angelo.\n\nHe groaned loudly. \"Oh Jenna, you're so good...\"\n\nJenna continued to pleasure Angelo. He held her head and synchronized the movement of her head up and down.\n\n\"I can't take it any longer.\" He stood her up.\n\n\"Sit on my lap.\"\n\nJenna yelled as she felt Angelo inside her\u2026\n\nHe held her waist and guided her up and down as she sat on him.\n\nJenna and Angelo enjoyed themselves all night long."

                      "text": "Chapter 0001\nIt was ten o'clock in the evening. Sydney Castro sat in front of the dressing table, rubbing essential oils on her body for that glowing skin.\n\nClearly, she was getting ready to please a man.\n\nHer husband, whom she had not seen for two years, was returning to Somerland today. She missed him terribly.\n\nSydney oiled every part of her body until she was soft and smooth. Then she put on a white, furry lingerie set with a cheeky little cat tail on the small of her back.\n\nIn truth, she did not have to go to such trouble in the past. Lorenzo had wished he could stick to her every day, but after that fateful day, everything changed.\n\nShe went from being his closest lover to the woman he hated the most.\n\nLater, their elders arranged for them to get married. However, Lorenzo was so reluctant that he left the country the day after signing their marriage certificate.\n\nNow two years have passed, during which he only contacted her once. It was six months after her mother's death that he sent her a divorce agreement.\n\nSydney did not sign the papers. She still harbored thoughts of rekindling her marriage with Lorenzo.\n\nHowever, it was difficult.\n\nShe was not even aware he was returning tonight. She only found out when she saw Lorenzo\u2019s friends posted about their drinking session on social media.\n\nLater, she called her mother-in-law, who helped her and sent a driver to bring Lorenzo back.\n\nThe driver called. Lorenzo would be home in a few minutes.\n\nShe had to seize this opportunity and try to rekindle their old flame again.\n\nIntentionally dressed up, she knelt on fours by the bed, evenly distributing the rose petals that had been sprinkled on the bed in advance. She was so engrossed that she did not notice a long shadow walking in.\n\nSuddenly, Sydney\u2019s cat tail was yanked hard as a hot-blooded torso pressed on her back. Her heart skipped a beat. She turned back and came face-to-face with a deep yet intense set of piercing eyes.\n\n\"Enzo...\" she began delicately, \"You finally came...\" Back.\n\nThe rest of her sentence was choked back by a kiss reeking of ethanol.\n\nSydney's eyelashes fluttered as her body responded to his. She was not sure whether Lorenzo was drunk or if her outfit tonight was a success. \n\nLorenzo kissed her so passionately that he wanted to suck her lips swollen. He placed his hands over her waist , grabbing them vigorously.\n\nThe man seemed satisfied. While taking a breath, he growled in a whisper. \"good...\"\n\nGrowling in a whisper was considered flirting. That was Lorenzo\u2019s special habit. \n\nRecently, she had been doing yoga. Her figure was way better than two years ago. This was also a surprise for Lorenzo. His words and actions ignited the fire in her heart.\n\nHer plump waist rose and fell violently. Her rapid breath escaped her rosy lips. Her glowy, fair hands explored his waist through his custom silk shirt, caressing his hard and steamy muscles for the first time in a long time. She hurriedly unbuttoned his shirt.\n\nThe smooth material slid down his strong arms. She unbuckled his belt and wrapped her legs around his waist.\n\nEight years of familiarity with each other made them very compatible in bed. No need for any fluff, they went straight into it.\n\nPerhaps it was because they had not seen each other for too long. His desire seemed to be even more intense than hers, just like when he first tasted the forbidden fruit eight years ago. The man was excited and tireless.\n\nThis went on for more than three hours. Finally, he was satisfied.\n\nSydney laid on the man's beautiful sculpted chest and kissed his handsome face obsessively, trying to make up for lost time.\n\nLorenzo kept his eyes closed, allowing her kisses.\n\n \"I'm very pleased with you tonight.\"Lorenzo said\n\nSydney smiled and kissed the corner of his lips again.\n\nLorenzo raised the corners of his lips. He grabbed her waist hard, and turned over to hold her down.\n\nSydney was sure that he was in a good mood now.\n\nShe stretched out her hand to rub his Adam's apple. Right before they did it again, she said bluntly, \"Enzo, four years ago\u2026I swear nothing happened between Oliver and I. My body and soul completely belong to you. You are finally back. Can we please forget what happened that day and move forward together?\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the smile on the man's face froze instantly.\n\nLorenzo raised his hand and grabbed Sydney\u2019s throat. \n\nSydney's heart skipped a beat. She widened her eyes in panic. It was over. She had said the wrong thing.\n\nThis happened twice before. If she mentioned the words \"four years ago\", Lorenzo would immediately become ruthless and sinister.\n\nHer best friend once said that Lorenzo's reaction was akin to PTSD, a post-traumatic stress reaction.\n\nShe had doubts at the time, and it turned out to be the same today, which proved that her best friend was right.\n\nIn a daze, she heard Lorenzo say, \"Move forward with me? You?\n\n\"I touched you tonight because I'm afraid that you,  wouldn\u2019t change your disgusting habit and sleep with my friends again!\"\n\n\"I won't, I didn\u2019t...\" Sydney explained and reached out to touch his hand, attempting to soothe him.\n\nLorenzo's hand tightened, \"Don't touch me!\"\n\nSydney's face was red from Lorenzo\u2019s grip on her throat.\n\nLorenzo took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. \"You'd better sign the divorce agreement as soon as possible. The past love we had will never be rekindled.\"\n\n The words \u2018divorce agreement\u2019 stabbed Sydney\u2019s heart like a sword. She looked up anxiously, and said with difficulty, \"We were so good back then. Are you going to completely deny all that I\u2019ve done for you, just because of that incident?\n\n\"Oliver and I both explained back then that nothing happened to us. We were set up!\"\n\nHowever, the more she explained, the angrier Lorenzo became. His hand went up her neck and grabbed her chin. The force in his grip became stronger and stronger. Sydney could feel that he wanted to crush her chin.\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\nHe ignored her cries of pain.\n\n\"Set up? Lying on the same bed with him might be a set up, but what about the child in your belly?\"\n\n\"Sydney, I wanted so badly for that baby to be mine at that time... But all the hospitals we went to in Quill City showed the same result: You were fifteen days conceived a baby.!\n\n\"I was on a business trip for two months and you were fifteen days conceived a baby. How could you make me believe that nothing happened between you and him?!\"\n\nAfter that, Lorenzo shook her off.\n\nSydney fell on the pillow. She straightened her messy hair, stood up again and explained shakily, \"But the first doctor I consulted was a traditional medicine practitioner. The old doctor said that I was two months conceived a baby. I didn't tell you immediately because I wanted to wait for you to come back to give you a surprise!\n\n\"You\u2019ve met that old doctor too. He showed you the prescription he gave me with the time written on it. Why won't you...\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Lorenzo interrupted her, \"Handwritten time has no credibility, and it's easier to bribe an old traditional medicine practitioner. Stop now and shut up!\"\n\nShe stood in his shoes and could understand the hurt in his heart. However, she still felt heartbroken from how he decisively shunned her.\n\nEspecially their child. The rejection was heartbreakingly painful.\n\nShe knew it was useless to say anything, so she kept quiet and shed tears of frustration.\n\nLorenzo got out of bed and made a phone call.\n\nThe room was quiet. As the call connected, Sydney heard the voice on the other end. She quickly got out of bed.\n\nA woman\u2019s voice. \"Mr. Bailey\u2026\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"Are you still here?\"\n\nWoman, \"Yes, do you want to come over?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lorenzo said and hung up the phone. \n\nSydney held him back. Her eyes widened with tears and her voice trembled. \"Are you seeing someone else?\"\n\nChapter 0002\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\nSydney\u2019s world collapsed as she burst into tears. \"When did it happen?! Who is she?!\"\n\nShe looked utterly miserable now. Lorenzo had no mercy, he might have even felt a little pleasure seeing her in pain.\n\n\"Can\u2019t stand seeing me with someone else?\"\n\nYes, she could not stand it.\n\nLoving a person would inherently make one possessive. Lorenzo meant so much to her that she could not accept losing him.\n\nAt this moment, the way she was just speechlessly hyperventilating due to the blow was more pathetic than crying. It felt like she was falling to pieces.\n\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He got dressed and left the bedroom.\n\nSydney refused to give up and chased after him. \"Why won\u2019t you believe that I was set up?\"\n\nLorenzo stopped and turned around. \"Then tell me, who set you up?\"\n\nThe corridor of the mansion was wide and long. Sydney was speechless as she looked at the lanky man in white shirt and trousers.    \n\nFour years ago, they talked about this many times. Each time they got stuck here.\n\nExactly.\n\nShe still did not find out who did it.\n\nThe setup was extremely vicious.\n\nLorenzo and Sydney\u2019s relationship turned from true love to pure hatred. They were so miserable for each other that it broke apart Lorenzo and Oliver\u2019s friendship. It also caused Sydney to become mentally ill, miscarrying from extreme heartache...\n\nHowever, she still could not identify the mastermind behind this! Four years ago, Sydney and Oliver searched for a long time but to no avail.\n\nLorenzo left.\n\nSydney stood in the corridor for a long time. She clutched her chest and raced towards the room at the corner of the corridor, calling out with each step, \"Mrs. Harper...\"\n\nHer breath became shorter each time.\n\nWhen she reached the door, she reached out and knocked, then her vision went dark as she fell to the ground unconscious.\n\nThe door opened shortly. The nanny had the shock of her life and quickly picked Sydney up in panic. \"Madam!\"\n\nThe sound of a car driving away was heard downstairs.\n\nSydney regained consciousness after Mrs. Harper gave her first aid.\n\nMrs. Harper had a glass of water and a handful of white pills in her hand. She said, \"Madam, why don't you tell your husband about your condition? If he sympathizes with you because of this, you might...\"\n\nSydney shook her head stubbornly, \"He and I are together because we love each other. I don't want to be pitied.\"\n\nShe took the pills and swallowed them. She closed her eyes and kept silent for a long time, then she said to Mrs. Harper, \"He\u2019s seeing someone else. I want to know who she is. Tell me, is it okay for me to ask his friends?\"\n\n\u2026\n\nMelon, the largest nightclub in Quill City.\n\nMusic was blaring in a VIP room. Lorenzo kicked the door open and went in. The men who were dancing intimately with the women almost soiled their pants.\n\nHowever, no one dared to be angry.\n\nLorenzo was a peculiar legend in Quill City. In his youth, he was an uncivilized and rebellious devil. Despite being a member of the Bailey Group, the wealthiest corporation in Quill City, he was cast out as the black sheep of the family and was dead broke.\n\nLater, his parents could not stand it anymore and made a plan for him to study abroad. He refused without hesitation. Instead, he relied on the prize money he got from a gaming tournament and simply enrolled himself in a vocational school.\n\nSuch a self-destructive person suddenly changed at the age of twenty.\n\nLorenzo became extremely hard-working. He diligently went to class and hung out in the library. He would also dress up and leave the dormitory at around six o'clock every morning. He rode the bicycle for an hour to Quill City Fine Arts Academy for lectures.\n\nSome people claimed that he had fallen in love with a student from Quill City Fine Arts Academy.\n\nNot long after, he wanted to start a company. His family was not supportive, of course. So, he put a knife to Grandpa Bailey\u2019s throat and grabbed 300 million to open a jewelry company, registered as Cherr.y.\n\nAt that time, the Baileys thought that the 300 million was burned for good. However, Cherr.y turned out to be unexpectedly successful. It made ten times the profit in its second year. In the fourth year, it was listed in Newford.\n\nToday, the \u2018Black Sheep\u2019 was a self-made man and had become the heir to the Bailey Group. Cherr.y had become a world-renowned jewelry brand.\n\nAs soon as Lorenzo sat down on the sofa, a group of beauties quickly came over and said, \"Mr. Bailey!\"\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nThe women trembled in fright and scurried away. Two more men sat down and said, \"Lorenzo, what pissed you off at home?\"\n\nLorenzo kept quiet. He picked up a glass and started chugging.\n\nThe others did not say anything anymore. They picked up their glass to drink with him.\n\nNot a moment later, someone's cell phone rang on the table.\n\n\"Xavier, your phone!\"\n\nA handsome man with platinum blond hair sat up on the sofa in a dark hidden corner.\n\nXavier woke up from his nap and scratched his tattooed neck. He took a look at his cell phone and his eyes widened.\n\n\"Lorenzo,\" he looked at Lorenzo, \"Why is Sydney calling me?\"\n\nLorenzo paused mid-drink and looked at Xavier. \"Who?\"\n\nXavier walked up to him with his cell phone, \"Your wife!\"\n\nLorenzo's expression turned sinister. \"When did you get her number?\"\n\nXavier said casually, \"On the day you both got married, I gave her my number when we sang together in the karaoke bar.\"\n\nHearing that, Lorenzo stood up abruptly and grabbed Xavier's collar, \"Who asked you to give your number?\"\n\nXavier frowned, puzzled at his friend\u2019s sudden rage. He pushed Lorenzo's hand away, \"We were all having fun, what\u2019s the big deal in exchanging contact information?\"\n\nLorenzo got angry. \"WHY\"\n\nWith that, he punched the undefended Xavier.\n\nXavier was caught off guard and slammed onto the marble table. The wine and glasses on the table clattered onto the floor.\n\nThe atmosphere froze. Lorenzo's eyes turned red like a furious beast. He growled, \"Delete her number!\"\n\nXavier was no sitting duck either. He was the second generation of the Altmans, an old money family in Quill City.  He was the prodigal son of the Altmans, a notorious troublemaker. He could hang out frequently with Lorenzo because they were similar.\n\nXavier wiped the bleeding corner of his lips and punched Lorenzo in return. \"What's going on, Popeye? Use your words, not your fists!\"\n\nLorenzo was hit on the head. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then he grabbed Xavier, pressed him on the sofa and beat him in a frenzy. \"How many times have you contacted Sydney in the past two years?!!\"\n\nXavier dodged Lorenzo's heavy punches and said, \"Why would I contact your wife like I have nothing else to do?! Have you gone mad? I'll admit you to the mental hospital!\"\n\nThese words seemed to hit a nerve. Lorenzo paused. \n\nHe was stunned for a few seconds. Then, he sat down on the side and then closed his eyes to quell the anger in his heart.\n\nXavier sat up, frowned and rubbed his shoulders. Vulgarities spewed.\n\nLorenzo ignored Xavier. After a while, he calmed down. He opened his eagle eyes and scanned the other men in the room, \"Who else saved her number?\"\n\nImmediately, several men lowered their heads to look for their phones.\n\nLorenzo was startled.\n\nImmediately, terrifying sounds of broken bottles filled the space, as well as Lorenzo's angry swear words, and screams of women as they dodge shards of glass.\n\nLorenzo seemed to have lost his mind and started attacking all his friends.\n\nXavier stepped outside with his cell phone and returned Sydney\u2019s call.\n\nWhen Sydney picked up, Xavier humbly said, \"Hi, Sydney. What's the matter?\"\n\nSydney's voice was gentle and polite. \"Xavier, I'm sorry to bother you. Lorenzo got a little upset with me tonight. He blocked me and I can't contact him. I wanted to ask if you know where he is.\"\n\nChapter 0003\n\"He was drinking with me, and now he's drunk and acting crazy. I'll send him back to you later. Don\u2019t worry.\"\n\nSydney paused for a moment then said, \"Can you give me the address? I want to check on him myself.\"\n\nXavier took a deep breath, opened the door and saw the chaos inside. He said, \"Melon, A.\"\n\nAbout ten minutes later, apart from Lorenzo and Xavier, everyone else left.\n\nLorenzo sat on the sofa. He stared at the chandelier on the ceiling, lost in thoughts.\n\nXavier sat next to him, \"We are not a part of your drama with Sydney. If anything, go home and solve it with her. Don't go crazy here.\"\n\nLorenzo closed his eyes. \"I\u2019m not going home.\"\n\n\"You must,\" \"Then tell me what happened between you two, I\u2019ll find a way for you.\"\n\nLorenzo, \"You can't.\"\n\n\u201cFine,\" Xavier said, \"If you won't go home, where will you go later?\"\n\n\"Chelsea will pick me up.\"\n\nXavier was stunned for a moment. \"Are you okay? You got so anxious when your wife called me. And now you\u2019re going to see another woman?\n\n\"I met you late. I don't know what happened between you and Sydney. You left her alone for two years, acting like you really don't care. However, we are not allowed to keep her contact information. What on earth are you thinking?\"\n\nLorenzo became impatient again. \"Boy, don\u2019t meddle with adult matters.\"\n\nWhen Xavier started to curse, a creaking sound came from the door. The two of them looked towards the door.\n\n\u201cEnzo,\u201d A sweet voice came.\n\nThe woman had the body of a devil and the face of an angel as she slithered in. She was the \u2018Nation\u2019s Goddess\u2019 and top tier actress, Chelsea Dune.\n \nLorenzo's expression finally softened a little when she appeared. \"Here she comes.\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows subtly.\n\nChelsea elegantly sat next to Lorenzo while avoiding the mess on the ground. She saw the cut at the corner of his eye.\n\nThe woman frowned. \"Why are you hurt?\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"It's nothing. I just drank too much.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt?\" As she spoke, Chelsea reached out and took Lorenzo's arm.\n\nXavier said with a smile, \"Hey Superstar, do you know he is married?\"\n\nChelsea paused and retracted her hand in embarrassment. \"Enzo and I are just friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, cool.\"\n\nLorenzo seemed displeased with Xavier's sarcasm towards Chelsea. He retorted, \"What are you trying to say?\"\n\nXavier stuck his tongue in his cheek and stood up with a grin. \"Nothing. Things among you guys are too complicated for my little brain. I\u2019m gonna go home to bed.\"\n\nAs soon as Xavier reached the door, the door was opened from the outside.\n\nXavier paused.\n\nSydney stood timidly at the door.\n\nShe was timid but she was objectively eye-catching.\n\nHer long, dark and wavy hair draped casually down her back. She had light makeup on her delicate and pretty face. Her lips were as bright as cherry, with a hint of sparkle.\n\nThe velvet, burgundy strappy dress contrasted with her flawless, snow-white skin. She was like a blooming red rose in the dark night.\n\nXavier gulped. He forgot how to speak at that moment.\n\nLorenzo's voice was suddenly heard. \"Who\u2019s there?\"\n\nXavier was stunned,and stepped aside to make way for Sydney. After Sydney entered the room, he exhaled and came back to his senses.\n\nAs soon as Sydney reached the door, she froze.\n\nEveryone had left. The private room had the brightest lights turned on. Right in the middle, Lorenzo and Chelsea were sitting together with their arms touching each other. To Sydney, that scene hurt her eyes more than the light.\n\nHer breath was stuck in her throat. Her lips quivered, but she could not say a word.\n\nLorenzo had an affair with Chelsea, her college bully!\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Lorenzo frowned, \"Go back!\"\n\nSydney shuddered then finally took a step. She quickened her pace.\n\nShe went up to the two of them. While everyone was caught off guard, she slapped Chelsea across the face and grabbed her hair. \"It's you!\"\n\nChelsea screamed, \"Ah! Enzo, help me!\"\n\n\u201cSydney!\u201d\n\nWhen Lorenzo spoke, Sydney let go of Chelsea. She raised her hand towards Lorenzo, but did not strike him.\n\nHer hands trembled. She broke down and shouted, \"You clearly know what she did to me back then! Of all the people, why her?!\"\n\nSuddenly.\n\nSlap!\n\nChelsea took advantage when Sydney was unguarded and slapped her back. That slap was even harder than Sydney\u2019s.\n\nSydney felt ringing in her ears, and then blood dripped from the corners of her lips.\n\nChelsea snarled, \"Why blame others if you can't keep your man?!\"\n\nSydney held her face. Her eyes turned red at Chelsea\u2019s smug expression. She shouted, \"I'm taking your life. \n\nShe tried to attack Chelsea again, but Lorenzo stopped her. He grabbed the back of her head and threw her to the other side of the sofa.\n\n\"I told you to go back, are you deaf?\"\n\nSydney felt as if she had gone deaf. The ringing in her ears was so severe that she couldn't hear what Lorenzo said. Half of her head was throbbing.\n\nAt this moment, Chelsea suddenly covered her ears and wailed, \"Enzo, I can't hear!\"\n\nLorenzo was shocked, \"You can\u2019t hear?\"\n\nChelsea's eyes widened in pity, and her cries became louder. \"I can't hear what you said...\"\n\nLorenzo looked back and glared at Sydney fiercely. He stood up, arms over Chelsea and walked out, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier, saw Lorenzo escorting a tearful Chelsea out of the room. He knew something was amiss and quickly entered the room.\n\nSydney closed her eyes and clasped her head with her hands. She fell sideways on the sofa. Her shoulders shook.\n\nAt the moment, half of that bright and charming face was as pale as paper, and the other half was marked with an angry palm print. The blood on the corners of her lips stood out even more.\n\nXavier's eyes widened and he rushed over. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney did not respond.\n\nXavier nudged her gently. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney then opened her eyes, her voice fading away, \"My, my ears hurt...\"\n\nWith the slap mark and her ear hurting, Xavier immediately understood what had happened. He helped Sydney up and said, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\nSydney only managed to take two steps before her legs gave way. She was about to crash.\n\nPeople lose strength when they cannot bear the pain. Sydney would rather die than have Lorenzo cheated on her with Chelsea.\n\nXavier felt a pang of distress. He carried Sydney in his arms and hurried out.\n\n\u2026\n\nLorenzo and Chelsea stopped outside the main entrance of Melon. He said, \"Wait for me here, I'll get the car.\"\n\nChelsea held him and said, \"Enzo, I'm better now. I don\u2019t think I need to go to the hospital. Come with me and stay with me, okay?\"\n\nLorenzo frowned, and just as he was about to agree, something behind Chelsea attracted his attention.\n\nXavier carried Sydney and walked quickly towards the parking lot.\n\nLorenzo frowned, \"Since you don't need to go to the hospital, you should go back to the hotel first.\"\n\nWith that, he turned to chase after Xavier, but Chelsea pulled him back. \"Are you going to look for Sydney? How could she treat you like that but you still can't let her go?\"\n\nChapter 0004\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He did not answer and strode after Xavier.\n\nChelsea exhaled forcefully. Her shoulders trembled. She looked at Sydney and Xavier with clear hatred and jealousy.\n\nHowever, Lorenzo did not manage to intercept Xavier. When he passed by, Xavier's car drifted gorgeously before merging onto the main freeway.\n\n\u2026\n\nInside the car.\n\nSydney crumpled into a ball and leaned against the car window. Xavier fastened the seat belt for her.\n\nTears streamed down her face the whole time, but she was expressionless, like a soulless sculpture.\n\nThe pain in her ear strained the nerves across her head, and pulled out many memories that she did not want to recall.\n\nA group of heavily made-up girls surrounded her. The proudest one leading the pack, was Chelsea, the one with the harmless face.\n\nHer smile was pure evil. She pulled Sydney\u2019s hair, and let her companions take turns to slap her. Chelsea dripped melted white ice cream on Sydney\u2019s face and chest.\n\nSydney dared not resist because her grandmother, Mary Collins, was in the hands of Christopher, Chelsea's father.\n\nThe Dunes were quite wealthy. Christopher owned a ceramics company, and Mary used to work as a cleaner in Christopher\u2019s office building.\n\nMary had always done a good job, but that day Chelsea insisted that Mary accidentally destroyed her father's documents. Even a fool knew that it was all a farce.\n\nSydney was a freshman that year and Chelsea was a sophomore.\n\nAt the Quill City Fine Arts Academy, Chelsea had always been the most sought-after goddess by many in the school. After Sydney entered the school, she stole Chelsea\u2019s glory.\n\nJealousy was written all over Chelsea's innocent face.\n\nChelsea took those humiliating photos and made Sydney look cheap. Soon, other people's harsh words tormented her as well.\n\nSydney, you are so pretty. If You planned turns a resentful woman,would your grandma still need to be a cleaner in her old age to support the family?\n\n\"Sydney! Hey, Sydney!\"\n\nXavier's words pulled her back from her thoughts.\n\nShe turned her head blankly to be met with a pair of gentle, concerned eyes.\n\nXavier saw her motionless and thought she had died with her eyes wide open.\n\nThe speed of the car was fast, and the pressure on her back felt comfortable. Sydney took the pills earlier and felt better because her discomfort was suppressed. Her ears still hurt but she could hear clearly.\n\n\"Xavier, thank you.\"\n\nXavier breathed out, \"As long as you're fine.\"\n\nSydney continued to be silent.\n\nIt was already four o'clock in the middle of the night. There were very few cars on the road.\n\nAfter Xavier turned a corner, he looked back at her.\n\nHis Adam's apple rolled quietly once more.\n\nSydney looked bright and charming from the front, but she looked even more striking with her smooth facial outline and high nose from the side. Her thick eyelashes were naturally curled; It felt like she was God\u2019s favorite.\n\nSydney stood out even among beauties and was considered stunning. She was spotted by a talent scout when she hit puberty in her first year of high school.\n\nHowever, her mother refused to allow her to enter the entertainment industry, so she had been keeping her head down at school. Initially, her mother had strict requirements. Sydney was not allowed to have long hair or wear nice clothes.\n\nThroughout high school, she had ugly short hair and wore puffy, outdated and tacky clothes. She was bullied when she started dressing up in college. It was not until she fell in love with that Black Sheep Enzo that she began to step out of her shell because she had someone to protect her.\n\nXavier broke the silence in the car again. \"You knew that all the boys have only known Lorenzo in the past three or four years. Am I right to say that you and Lorenzo have known each other for a long time?\"\n\nWith that, Sydney said, \"Yeah, he was my first love. I dated him when I was a freshman. He stayed with me throughout my college days for four years. We broke up when I graduated...\"\n\n\"After two years of separation, the elders in our respective families crossed paths by accident, and they arranged for us to get married for some reason. I was willing to get married, but he was not.\"\n\nXavier frowned. \"Do you...love him very much?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Sydney\u2019s voice trembled again, \"He used to be... very good to me. Extremely good.\"\n\nShe was deeply caught up by their love, whereby a simple sentence could dig up those heavy and profound memories.\n\n\"I don't have a father. Lorenzo not only gave me the sense of security that a boyfriend should, but he was protective like a father.\n\n\"For every holiday, others are picked up by their parents, but Lorenzo picked me up. At every start of the school season, parents would send their kids to class, but Lorenzo would send me. The day before school started, he would help me check my luggage. He would make sure I had everything I needed. He would also secretly put money into the pockets of my clothes.\u201d\n\nSydney's tears rolled down her cheeks again as she recalled those memories.\n\nXavier tightened his grip on the steering wheel. His expression became heavy. He did not expect Lorenzo to have such a tender and considerate side.\n\nHowever, tenderness and consideration were the most fearful things in a relationship because trying to move on after a breakup was tantamount to chipping away at the bones.\n\nAfter a moment, Xavier spoke, \"You are now... relying on his past kindness to you to support your marriage.\"\n\nThis sentence summed up her lonely married life for the past two years. Sydney lifted her hand and wiped her eyes, \"I am not willing to lose him. We were so good together; I really can't accept the current situation...\"\n   \n\nXavier said, \"But Sydney, have you ever thought about it? Many couples who have been estranged were once deeply in love in the past. You\u2019ve been tormenting yourself by living in the past. You will definitely meet a man who treats you better in the future.\"\n\nSydney sobbed, \"I tried moving on, but I still can't get over...\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows and changed his approach. \"Chelsea hit you, but he took Chelsea away without concern for you. Can you bear it?\"\n\nSydney was stunned for a moment. The hidden deep affection in her eyes was immediately replaced by hatred as her emotions flared up.\n\n\"No, I told Lorenzo from the start that anyone who is friends with Chelsea is my enemy. Did Lorenzo really have feelings for Chelsea, or did he do it deliberately to spite me...\n\n\"No, I can't think like that either,\" she began to mumble through her chaotic thoughts, \"No matter what his purpose is, if he really slept with Chelsea...\"\n\nShe did not continue, but closed her eyes and began to take deep breaths.\n\nSome scenes were just fantasies, but enough to suffocate her.\n\nXavier's heart ached a little when he saw Sydney in pain. At the same time, he was also curious about what happened between Sydney and Chelsea.\n\nJust as he was about to ask, his cell phone, which he had thrown inside the armrest storage, rang.\n\nHe looked down. It was a call from Lorenzo.\n\nXavier frowned, turned over his phone and clicked to hang up. He glanced in the rearview mirror again.\n\nBehind him was a flashy, black and red car, the world\u2019s rarest supercar. A toy owned by the richest man in Quill City.\n\nXavier looked at Sydney again. Her sobs could really melt a man's heart. He secretly gripped the steering wheel.\n\nIt was not Sydney who gave him her number first. The men, including him, noticed Lorenzo's indifference towards her, but were too captivated by her beauty, so they asked for it behind Lorenzo's back.\n\nOf course, they all found a perfect reason. They asked Sydney to leave her number, so they could contact her for business purposes.\n\nAt that time, no one dared to have filthy intentions. She was Lorenzo's legal wife, and Lorenzo was one of the most outstanding people among his friends.\n\nAside from the fact that Sydney was married, she was indeed a rare beauty. Everyone thought it was harmless to keep a beautiful woman\u2019s phone number.\n\nHowever, things were different now.\n\nHe swerved the steering wheel abruptly and turned around in the opposite direction. He accelerated to 200 miles an hour, and threw Lorenzo off his trail.\n\nChapter 0005\nXavier was driving dangerously fast, but his expression was exceptionally calm.\n\nIn addition to running several companies, he was also a part-time F2 racing driver.\n\nFor Lorenzo, the supercar was just a means of transportation, but in Xavier's hands, it was a toy. He was sure that Lorenzo would not be able to catch up.\n\nLorenzo watched Xavier's car zoom by his car like a ghost. He was stunned for a moment and quickly turned around. Two minutes later, he lost them.\n\nHe continued to call Xavier while flooring the accelerator, but still no one answered.\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier knew that he had other intentions when he ditched Lorenzo, but he dared not show it in front of Sydney right away.\n\nAfter all, she was still Lorenzo's wife. Xavier was one year younger than Lorenzo whom he regarded as his blood brother, so she was his sister-in-law, in a sense.\n\nHe took her to the hospital as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter the medical check-up to make sure there were no major problems, Xavier took Sydney back to Celestial Park after applying ice patches to her face.\n\nCelestial Park was a famous luxury residential area in Quill City. Sydney and Lorenzo bought their marital home here.\n\nAs soon as Sydney got to the bedroom, she saw Lorenzo sitting on the sofa at the end of the bed. There was a bottle of white wine on the round table next to him.\n\nSydney's eyes flashed. Without saying a word, she went to bed, lay down, and closed her eyes.\n\nA few seconds later, the man's footsteps were heard.\n\nSydney shivered. Her eyelashes became wet again.\n\nLorenzo suddenly got on the bed and pressed on her. She opened her eyes and started to push him away. \"Don't touch me...\"\n\nLorenzo paused, grabbed her collar with both hands, and tore her skirt apart.\n\nSydney's eyes widened with shock. Her screams echoed through the bedroom. \"Don't touch me with the hand you used to touch Chelsea Dune!\"\n\nLorenzo froze.\n\nSydney looked at him as tears poured down her face. \"I can have no dignity in front of you because we were dependent on each other for those four years. You provided a great deal for me, and you are also the closest person to me besides my mother and grandmother. My heart breaks for you because you were hurt by what happened back then. I can\u2019t bear to see you in deep pain every day because of me so I allow you to vent your grievances by hurting me!\n\n\u201cBut I can't share the same man with Chelsea, and I can't have the hand that touched her, touch me!!\n\n\u201cShe is the last straw of my dignity, Lorenzo!\"\n\nHowever, these words did not move Lorenzo to show any guilt.\n\nInstead, he became angrier. \"What about my last straw?\"\n\n\"I was disgusted by you too after Oliver touched you. What you do that night when we got registered?\"\n  \nSydney trembled. She choked.\n\nThat night.\n  \nHer mother and mother-in-law both wanted to seize the opportunity so that she and Lorenzo could have a child as soon as possible, so they tampered with their tea.\n\nLorenzo thought it was Sydney who Framed him.\n\n\"Why aren't you talking?\" Lorenzo's eyes were red as he stared into hers, \"Where did Xavier take you? He deliberately didn't answer my call. What did you do?\"\n\n\"Can you stop being suspicious of everyone and anyone? He took me to the hospital!\"\n\n\"Hospital?\" Lorenzo sneered, and he tightened his grip on her clothes, this time tearing her skirt all the way, \"Sydney, lift your legs for me!\"\n\nSydney panicked. \"What are you going to do?!\"\n\n\"Let's see if you betrayed me again!\"\n\nSydney immediately closed her knees together, \"I didn't!\"\n\nLorenzo pressed harder and his voice became more forceful, \"I don't believe a word you said!\"\n\nSuch stubborn words made Sydney lose the will to refute him.\n\nShe looked at Lorenzo\u2019s frightening and gloomy face and felt disgusted with him for the first time.\n\nShe reached out and pinched the back of his hand. \"Let me go, I'm tired, I want to sleep!\"\n\n\"I don't want to sleep, why should you sleep!\" Lorenzo was still furious. He did not seem to feel any pain in the back of his hand. The grip in his hand became stronger and stronger.\n\nHe pulled apart Sydney's knees quickly. He spread her legs apart so hard that even her behinds hurt.\n\nHe was worried that she would resist, so he pressed his knee on her belly and untied his belt.\n\nSydney's tears rolled to the side of her temples and wet the pillow. Still, she said nothing. Since pinching the back of his hand did not work, she pinched his neck hard.\n\nLorenzo winced in pain, but still did not let her go.\n\nIt felt as if he would not give up if he did not test her.\n\nLorenzo's neck,and even his arms and abdominal muscles were left bruised from Sydney's pinching while she gradually lost hope.\n\nShe wilted like dry roses, losing all trace of vitality.\n\nLorenzo endured the pain and tried to control her, but failed.\n\nSydney's tearful eyes trembled. Her hand squeezing his chest loosened, and she finally spoke again, \"Is that enough?\"\n\n\"Enough?\" Unexpectedly, Lorenzo felt even more enraged. He reached out and yanked open the drawer on the bedside table, took out the bottle of essential oil she bought, and then slammed the drawer shut!\n\nSydney seized this opportunity and tried to escape, but he grabbed her ankle in time. \"Be good!\"\n\nSydney stopped resisting. She knew she would not be able to escape tonight.\n\nShe was in tears, but she laughed. \"Lorenzo, I really didn't expect that one day I would be disgusted with you. Go ahead, disgust me more. So I can hate you enough, and give you what you want...\"\n\nShe thought, \u2018Lorenzo should know what I was referring to.\u2019\n\nIn the split second, her refusal to sign the divorce agreement suddenly wavered.\n\nDuring the time between being taken away by Xavier and being sent back home, she had been recalling the past.\n\nWhen she recalled the past with Chelsea, she did not want to lose her self-esteem. However, when she recalled every moment with Lorenzo, she did not want to regret losing the man she loved most.\n\nShe was deeply confused by these opposing feelings.\n\nHowever, right now, she actually felt disgusted with the man she loved most.\n\nShe was glad.\n\nDisgusted by him meant that she could finally let him go one day. \n\nLorenzo's face darkened at Sydney\u2019s words. He could not tell whether he was angry or something else.\n\nShe wanted to say more, but Lorenzo's lips suddenly covered hers.\n\nAt the same time, his fingertips of both hands trailed up along her waistline.\n\nThe faint smell of tobacco mixed with the fragrance and wine was an alluring masculine aroma. In the past, she could never resist his kisses.\n\nLorenzo was even wilder in the past than he is now. He was like a lion in the savanna. The passion and impulse he made her feel was strong and without restraint.\n\nApart from the four years they were separated, they had slept together for four years until now. He understood every part of her body, her preferred tension and pressure.\n\nSoon, her body reacted uncontrollably."

                      "text": "Chapter 0001\nIt was ten o'clock in the evening. Sydney Castro sat in front of the dressing table, rubbing essential oils on her body for that glowing skin.\n\nClearly, she was getting ready to please a man.\n\nHer husband, whom she had not seen for two years, was returning to Somerland today. She missed him terribly.\n\nSydney oiled every part of her body until she was soft and smooth. Then she put on a white, furry lingerie set with a cheeky little cat tail on the small of her back.\n\nIn truth, she did not have to go to such trouble in the past. Lorenzo had wished he could stick to her every day, but after that fateful day, everything changed.\n\nShe went from being his closest lover to the woman he hated the most.\n\nLater, their elders arranged for them to get married. However, Lorenzo was so reluctant that he left the country the day after signing their marriage certificate.\n\nNow two years have passed, during which he only contacted her once. It was six months after her mother's death that he sent her a divorce agreement.\n\nSydney did not sign the papers. She still harbored thoughts of rekindling her marriage with Lorenzo.\n\nHowever, it was difficult.\n\nShe was not even aware he was returning tonight. She only found out when she saw Lorenzo\u2019s friends posted about their drinking session on social media.\n\nLater, she called her mother-in-law, who helped her and sent a driver to bring Lorenzo back.\n\nThe driver called. Lorenzo would be home in a few minutes.\n\nShe had to seize this opportunity and try to rekindle their old flame again.\n\nIntentionally dressed up, she knelt on fours by the bed, evenly distributing the rose petals that had been sprinkled on the bed in advance. She was so engrossed that she did not notice a long shadow walking in.\n\nSuddenly, Sydney\u2019s cat tail was yanked hard as a hot-blooded torso pressed on her back. Her heart skipped a beat. She turned back and came face-to-face with a deep yet intense set of piercing eyes.\n\n\"Enzo...\" she began delicately, \"You finally came...\" Back.\n\nThe rest of her sentence was choked back by a kiss reeking of ethanol.\n\nSydney's eyelashes fluttered as her body responded to his. She was not sure whether Lorenzo was drunk or if her outfit tonight was a success. \n\nLorenzo kissed her so passionately that he wanted to suck her lips swollen. He placed his hands over her waist , grabbing them vigorously.\n\nThe man seemed satisfied. While taking a breath, he growled in a whisper. \"good...\"\n\nGrowling in a whisper was considered flirting. That was Lorenzo\u2019s special habit. \n\nRecently, she had been doing yoga. Her figure was way better than two years ago. This was also a surprise for Lorenzo. His words and actions ignited the fire in her heart.\n\nHer plump waist rose and fell violently. Her rapid breath escaped her rosy lips. Her glowy, fair hands explored his waist through his custom silk shirt, caressing his hard and steamy muscles for the first time in a long time. She hurriedly unbuttoned his shirt.\n\nThe smooth material slid down his strong arms. She unbuckled his belt and wrapped her legs around his waist.\n\nEight years of familiarity with each other made them very compatible in bed. No need for any fluff, they went straight into it.\n\nPerhaps it was because they had not seen each other for too long. His desire seemed to be even more intense than hers, just like when he first tasted the forbidden fruit eight years ago. The man was excited and tireless.\n\nThis went on for more than three hours. Finally, he was satisfied.\n\nSydney laid on the man's beautiful sculpted chest and kissed his handsome face obsessively, trying to make up for lost time.\n\nLorenzo kept his eyes closed, allowing her kisses.\n\n \"I'm very pleased with you tonight.\"Lorenzo said\n\nSydney smiled and kissed the corner of his lips again.\n\nLorenzo raised the corners of his lips. He grabbed her waist hard, and turned over to hold her down.\n\nSydney was sure that he was in a good mood now.\n\nShe stretched out her hand to rub his Adam's apple. Right before they did it again, she said bluntly, \"Enzo, four years ago\u2026I swear nothing happened between Oliver and I. My body and soul completely belong to you. You are finally back. Can we please forget what happened that day and move forward together?\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the smile on the man's face froze instantly.\n\nLorenzo raised his hand and grabbed Sydney\u2019s throat. \n\nSydney's heart skipped a beat. She widened her eyes in panic. It was over. She had said the wrong thing.\n\nThis happened twice before. If she mentioned the words \"four years ago\", Lorenzo would immediately become ruthless and sinister.\n\nHer best friend once said that Lorenzo's reaction was akin to PTSD, a post-traumatic stress reaction.\n\nShe had doubts at the time, and it turned out to be the same today, which proved that her best friend was right.\n\nIn a daze, she heard Lorenzo say, \"Move forward with me? You?\n\n\"I touched you tonight because I'm afraid that you,  wouldn\u2019t change your disgusting habit and sleep with my friends again!\"\n\n\"I won't, I didn\u2019t...\" Sydney explained and reached out to touch his hand, attempting to soothe him.\n\nLorenzo's hand tightened, \"Don't touch me!\"\n\nSydney's face was red from Lorenzo\u2019s grip on her throat.\n\nLorenzo took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. \"You'd better sign the divorce agreement as soon as possible. The past love we had will never be rekindled.\"\n\n The words \u2018divorce agreement\u2019 stabbed Sydney\u2019s heart like a sword. She looked up anxiously, and said with difficulty, \"We were so good back then. Are you going to completely deny all that I\u2019ve done for you, just because of that incident?\n\n\"Oliver and I both explained back then that nothing happened to us. We were set up!\"\n\nHowever, the more she explained, the angrier Lorenzo became. His hand went up her neck and grabbed her chin. The force in his grip became stronger and stronger. Sydney could feel that he wanted to crush her chin.\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\nHe ignored her cries of pain.\n\n\"Set up? Lying on the same bed with him might be a set up, but what about the child in your belly?\"\n\n\"Sydney, I wanted so badly for that baby to be mine at that time... But all the hospitals we went to in Quill City showed the same result: You were fifteen days conceived a baby.!\n\n\"I was on a business trip for two months and you were fifteen days conceived a baby. How could you make me believe that nothing happened between you and him?!\"\n\nAfter that, Lorenzo shook her off.\n\nSydney fell on the pillow. She straightened her messy hair, stood up again and explained shakily, \"But the first doctor I consulted was a traditional medicine practitioner. The old doctor said that I was two months conceived a baby. I didn't tell you immediately because I wanted to wait for you to come back to give you a surprise!\n\n\"You\u2019ve met that old doctor too. He showed you the prescription he gave me with the time written on it. Why won't you...\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Lorenzo interrupted her, \"Handwritten time has no credibility, and it's easier to bribe an old traditional medicine practitioner. Stop now and shut up!\"\n\nShe stood in his shoes and could understand the hurt in his heart. However, she still felt heartbroken from how he decisively shunned her.\n\nEspecially their child. The rejection was heartbreakingly painful.\n\nShe knew it was useless to say anything, so she kept quiet and shed tears of frustration.\n\nLorenzo got out of bed and made a phone call.\n\nThe room was quiet. As the call connected, Sydney heard the voice on the other end. She quickly got out of bed.\n\nA woman\u2019s voice. \"Mr. Bailey\u2026\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"Are you still here?\"\n\nWoman, \"Yes, do you want to come over?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lorenzo said and hung up the phone. \n\nSydney held him back. Her eyes widened with tears and her voice trembled. \"Are you seeing someone else?\"\n\nChapter 0002\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\nSydney\u2019s world collapsed as she burst into tears. \"When did it happen?! Who is she?!\"\n\nShe looked utterly miserable now. Lorenzo had no mercy, he might have even felt a little pleasure seeing her in pain.\n\n\"Can\u2019t stand seeing me with someone else?\"\n\nYes, she could not stand it.\n\nLoving a person would inherently make one possessive. Lorenzo meant so much to her that she could not accept losing him.\n\nAt this moment, the way she was just speechlessly hyperventilating due to the blow was more pathetic than crying. It felt like she was falling to pieces.\n\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He got dressed and left the bedroom.\n\nSydney refused to give up and chased after him. \"Why won\u2019t you believe that I was set up?\"\n\nLorenzo stopped and turned around. \"Then tell me, who set you up?\"\n\nThe corridor of the mansion was wide and long. Sydney was speechless as she looked at the lanky man in white shirt and trousers.    \n\nFour years ago, they talked about this many times. Each time they got stuck here.\n\nExactly.\n\nShe still did not find out who did it.\n\nThe setup was extremely vicious.\n\nLorenzo and Sydney\u2019s relationship turned from true love to pure hatred. They were so miserable for each other that it broke apart Lorenzo and Oliver\u2019s friendship. It also caused Sydney to become mentally ill, miscarrying from extreme heartache...\n\nHowever, she still could not identify the mastermind behind this! Four years ago, Sydney and Oliver searched for a long time but to no avail.\n\nLorenzo left.\n\nSydney stood in the corridor for a long time. She clutched her chest and raced towards the room at the corner of the corridor, calling out with each step, \"Mrs. Harper...\"\n\nHer breath became shorter each time.\n\nWhen she reached the door, she reached out and knocked, then her vision went dark as she fell to the ground unconscious.\n\nThe door opened shortly. The nanny had the shock of her life and quickly picked Sydney up in panic. \"Madam!\"\n\nThe sound of a car driving away was heard downstairs.\n\nSydney regained consciousness after Mrs. Harper gave her first aid.\n\nMrs. Harper had a glass of water and a handful of white pills in her hand. She said, \"Madam, why don't you tell your husband about your condition? If he sympathizes with you because of this, you might...\"\n\nSydney shook her head stubbornly, \"He and I are together because we love each other. I don't want to be pitied.\"\n\nShe took the pills and swallowed them. She closed her eyes and kept silent for a long time, then she said to Mrs. Harper, \"He\u2019s seeing someone else. I want to know who she is. Tell me, is it okay for me to ask his friends?\"\n\n\u2026\n\nMelon, the largest nightclub in Quill City.\n\nMusic was blaring in a VIP room. Lorenzo kicked the door open and went in. The men who were dancing intimately with the women almost soiled their pants.\n\nHowever, no one dared to be angry.\n\nLorenzo was a peculiar legend in Quill City. In his youth, he was an uncivilized and rebellious devil. Despite being a member of the Bailey Group, the wealthiest corporation in Quill City, he was cast out as the black sheep of the family and was dead broke.\n\nLater, his parents could not stand it anymore and made a plan for him to study abroad. He refused without hesitation. Instead, he relied on the prize money he got from a gaming tournament and simply enrolled himself in a vocational school.\n\nSuch a self-destructive person suddenly changed at the age of twenty.\n\nLorenzo became extremely hard-working. He diligently went to class and hung out in the library. He would also dress up and leave the dormitory at around six o'clock every morning. He rode the bicycle for an hour to Quill City Fine Arts Academy for lectures.\n\nSome people claimed that he had fallen in love with a student from Quill City Fine Arts Academy.\n\nNot long after, he wanted to start a company. His family was not supportive, of course. So, he put a knife to Grandpa Bailey\u2019s throat and grabbed 300 million to open a jewelry company, registered as Cherr.y.\n\nAt that time, the Baileys thought that the 300 million was burned for good. However, Cherr.y turned out to be unexpectedly successful. It made ten times the profit in its second year. In the fourth year, it was listed in Newford.\n\nToday, the \u2018Black Sheep\u2019 was a self-made man and had become the heir to the Bailey Group. Cherr.y had become a world-renowned jewelry brand.\n\nAs soon as Lorenzo sat down on the sofa, a group of beauties quickly came over and said, \"Mr. Bailey!\"\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nThe women trembled in fright and scurried away. Two more men sat down and said, \"Lorenzo, what pissed you off at home?\"\n\nLorenzo kept quiet. He picked up a glass and started chugging.\n\nThe others did not say anything anymore. They picked up their glass to drink with him.\n\nNot a moment later, someone's cell phone rang on the table.\n\n\"Xavier, your phone!\"\n\nA handsome man with platinum blond hair sat up on the sofa in a dark hidden corner.\n\nXavier woke up from his nap and scratched his tattooed neck. He took a look at his cell phone and his eyes widened.\n\n\"Lorenzo,\" he looked at Lorenzo, \"Why is Sydney calling me?\"\n\nLorenzo paused mid-drink and looked at Xavier. \"Who?\"\n\nXavier walked up to him with his cell phone, \"Your wife!\"\n\nLorenzo's expression turned sinister. \"When did you get her number?\"\n\nXavier said casually, \"On the day you both got married, I gave her my number when we sang together in the karaoke bar.\"\n\nHearing that, Lorenzo stood up abruptly and grabbed Xavier's collar, \"Who asked you to give your number?\"\n\nXavier frowned, puzzled at his friend\u2019s sudden rage. He pushed Lorenzo's hand away, \"We were all having fun, what\u2019s the big deal in exchanging contact information?\"\n\nLorenzo got angry. \"WHY\"\n\nWith that, he punched the undefended Xavier.\n\nXavier was caught off guard and slammed onto the marble table. The wine and glasses on the table clattered onto the floor.\n\nThe atmosphere froze. Lorenzo's eyes turned red like a furious beast. He growled, \"Delete her number!\"\n\nXavier was no sitting duck either. He was the second generation of the Altmans, an old money family in Quill City.  He was the prodigal son of the Altmans, a notorious troublemaker. He could hang out frequently with Lorenzo because they were similar.\n\nXavier wiped the bleeding corner of his lips and punched Lorenzo in return. \"What's going on, Popeye? Use your words, not your fists!\"\n\nLorenzo was hit on the head. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then he grabbed Xavier, pressed him on the sofa and beat him in a frenzy. \"How many times have you contacted Sydney in the past two years?!!\"\n\nXavier dodged Lorenzo's heavy punches and said, \"Why would I contact your wife like I have nothing else to do?! Have you gone mad? I'll admit you to the mental hospital!\"\n\nThese words seemed to hit a nerve. Lorenzo paused. \n\nHe was stunned for a few seconds. Then, he sat down on the side and then closed his eyes to quell the anger in his heart.\n\nXavier sat up, frowned and rubbed his shoulders. Vulgarities spewed.\n\nLorenzo ignored Xavier. After a while, he calmed down. He opened his eagle eyes and scanned the other men in the room, \"Who else saved her number?\"\n\nImmediately, several men lowered their heads to look for their phones.\n\nLorenzo was startled.\n\nImmediately, terrifying sounds of broken bottles filled the space, as well as Lorenzo's angry swear words, and screams of women as they dodge shards of glass.\n\nLorenzo seemed to have lost his mind and started attacking all his friends.\n\nXavier stepped outside with his cell phone and returned Sydney\u2019s call.\n\nWhen Sydney picked up, Xavier humbly said, \"Hi, Sydney. What's the matter?\"\n\nSydney's voice was gentle and polite. \"Xavier, I'm sorry to bother you. Lorenzo got a little upset with me tonight. He blocked me and I can't contact him. I wanted to ask if you know where he is.\"\n\nChapter 0003\n\"He was drinking with me, and now he's drunk and acting crazy. I'll send him back to you later. Don\u2019t worry.\"\n\nSydney paused for a moment then said, \"Can you give me the address? I want to check on him myself.\"\n\nXavier took a deep breath, opened the door and saw the chaos inside. He said, \"Melon, A.\"\n\nAbout ten minutes later, apart from Lorenzo and Xavier, everyone else left.\n\nLorenzo sat on the sofa. He stared at the chandelier on the ceiling, lost in thoughts.\n\nXavier sat next to him, \"We are not a part of your drama with Sydney. If anything, go home and solve it with her. Don't go crazy here.\"\n\nLorenzo closed his eyes. \"I\u2019m not going home.\"\n\n\"You must,\" \"Then tell me what happened between you two, I\u2019ll find a way for you.\"\n\nLorenzo, \"You can't.\"\n\n\u201cFine,\" Xavier said, \"If you won't go home, where will you go later?\"\n\n\"Chelsea will pick me up.\"\n\nXavier was stunned for a moment. \"Are you okay? You got so anxious when your wife called me. And now you\u2019re going to see another woman?\n\n\"I met you late. I don't know what happened between you and Sydney. You left her alone for two years, acting like you really don't care. However, we are not allowed to keep her contact information. What on earth are you thinking?\"\n\nLorenzo became impatient again. \"Boy, don\u2019t meddle with adult matters.\"\n\nWhen Xavier started to curse, a creaking sound came from the door. The two of them looked towards the door.\n\n\u201cEnzo,\u201d A sweet voice came.\n\nThe woman had the body of a devil and the face of an angel as she slithered in. She was the \u2018Nation\u2019s Goddess\u2019 and top tier actress, Chelsea Dune.\n \nLorenzo's expression finally softened a little when she appeared. \"Here she comes.\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows subtly.\n\nChelsea elegantly sat next to Lorenzo while avoiding the mess on the ground. She saw the cut at the corner of his eye.\n\nThe woman frowned. \"Why are you hurt?\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"It's nothing. I just drank too much.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt?\" As she spoke, Chelsea reached out and took Lorenzo's arm.\n\nXavier said with a smile, \"Hey Superstar, do you know he is married?\"\n\nChelsea paused and retracted her hand in embarrassment. \"Enzo and I are just friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, cool.\"\n\nLorenzo seemed displeased with Xavier's sarcasm towards Chelsea. He retorted, \"What are you trying to say?\"\n\nXavier stuck his tongue in his cheek and stood up with a grin. \"Nothing. Things among you guys are too complicated for my little brain. I\u2019m gonna go home to bed.\"\n\nAs soon as Xavier reached the door, the door was opened from the outside.\n\nXavier paused.\n\nSydney stood timidly at the door.\n\nShe was timid but she was objectively eye-catching.\n\nHer long, dark and wavy hair draped casually down her back. She had light makeup on her delicate and pretty face. Her lips were as bright as cherry, with a hint of sparkle.\n\nThe velvet, burgundy strappy dress contrasted with her flawless, snow-white skin. She was like a blooming red rose in the dark night.\n\nXavier gulped. He forgot how to speak at that moment.\n\nLorenzo's voice was suddenly heard. \"Who\u2019s there?\"\n\nXavier was stunned,and stepped aside to make way for Sydney. After Sydney entered the room, he exhaled and came back to his senses.\n\nAs soon as Sydney reached the door, she froze.\n\nEveryone had left. The private room had the brightest lights turned on. Right in the middle, Lorenzo and Chelsea were sitting together with their arms touching each other. To Sydney, that scene hurt her eyes more than the light.\n\nHer breath was stuck in her throat. Her lips quivered, but she could not say a word.\n\nLorenzo had an affair with Chelsea, her college bully!\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Lorenzo frowned, \"Go back!\"\n\nSydney shuddered then finally took a step. She quickened her pace.\n\nShe went up to the two of them. While everyone was caught off guard, she slapped Chelsea across the face and grabbed her hair. \"It's you!\"\n\nChelsea screamed, \"Ah! Enzo, help me!\"\n\n\u201cSydney!\u201d\n\nWhen Lorenzo spoke, Sydney let go of Chelsea. She raised her hand towards Lorenzo, but did not strike him.\n\nHer hands trembled. She broke down and shouted, \"You clearly know what she did to me back then! Of all the people, why her?!\"\n\nSuddenly.\n\nSlap!\n\nChelsea took advantage when Sydney was unguarded and slapped her back. That slap was even harder than Sydney\u2019s.\n\nSydney felt ringing in her ears, and then blood dripped from the corners of her lips.\n\nChelsea snarled, \"Why blame others if you can't keep your man?!\"\n\nSydney held her face. Her eyes turned red at Chelsea\u2019s smug expression. She shouted, \"I'm taking your life. \n\nShe tried to attack Chelsea again, but Lorenzo stopped her. He grabbed the back of her head and threw her to the other side of the sofa.\n\n\"I told you to go back, are you deaf?\"\n\nSydney felt as if she had gone deaf. The ringing in her ears was so severe that she couldn't hear what Lorenzo said. Half of her head was throbbing.\n\nAt this moment, Chelsea suddenly covered her ears and wailed, \"Enzo, I can't hear!\"\n\nLorenzo was shocked, \"You can\u2019t hear?\"\n\nChelsea's eyes widened in pity, and her cries became louder. \"I can't hear what you said...\"\n\nLorenzo looked back and glared at Sydney fiercely. He stood up, arms over Chelsea and walked out, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier, saw Lorenzo escorting a tearful Chelsea out of the room. He knew something was amiss and quickly entered the room.\n\nSydney closed her eyes and clasped her head with her hands. She fell sideways on the sofa. Her shoulders shook.\n\nAt the moment, half of that bright and charming face was as pale as paper, and the other half was marked with an angry palm print. The blood on the corners of her lips stood out even more.\n\nXavier's eyes widened and he rushed over. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney did not respond.\n\nXavier nudged her gently. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney then opened her eyes, her voice fading away, \"My, my ears hurt...\"\n\nWith the slap mark and her ear hurting, Xavier immediately understood what had happened. He helped Sydney up and said, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\nSydney only managed to take two steps before her legs gave way. She was about to crash.\n\nPeople lose strength when they cannot bear the pain. Sydney would rather die than have Lorenzo cheated on her with Chelsea.\n\nXavier felt a pang of distress. He carried Sydney in his arms and hurried out.\n\n\u2026\n\nLorenzo and Chelsea stopped outside the main entrance of Melon. He said, \"Wait for me here, I'll get the car.\"\n\nChelsea held him and said, \"Enzo, I'm better now. I don\u2019t think I need to go to the hospital. Come with me and stay with me, okay?\"\n\nLorenzo frowned, and just as he was about to agree, something behind Chelsea attracted his attention.\n\nXavier carried Sydney and walked quickly towards the parking lot.\n\nLorenzo frowned, \"Since you don't need to go to the hospital, you should go back to the hotel first.\"\n\nWith that, he turned to chase after Xavier, but Chelsea pulled him back. \"Are you going to look for Sydney? How could she treat you like that but you still can't let her go?\"\n\nChapter 0004\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He did not answer and strode after Xavier.\n\nChelsea exhaled forcefully. Her shoulders trembled. She looked at Sydney and Xavier with clear hatred and jealousy.\n\nHowever, Lorenzo did not manage to intercept Xavier. When he passed by, Xavier's car drifted gorgeously before merging onto the main freeway.\n\n\u2026\n\nInside the car.\n\nSydney crumpled into a ball and leaned against the car window. Xavier fastened the seat belt for her.\n\nTears streamed down her face the whole time, but she was expressionless, like a soulless sculpture.\n\nThe pain in her ear strained the nerves across her head, and pulled out many memories that she did not want to recall.\n\nA group of heavily made-up girls surrounded her. The proudest one leading the pack, was Chelsea, the one with the harmless face.\n\nHer smile was pure evil. She pulled Sydney\u2019s hair, and let her companions take turns to slap her. Chelsea dripped melted white ice cream on Sydney\u2019s face and chest.\n\nSydney dared not resist because her grandmother, Mary Collins, was in the hands of Christopher, Chelsea's father.\n\nThe Dunes were quite wealthy. Christopher owned a ceramics company, and Mary used to work as a cleaner in Christopher\u2019s office building.\n\nMary had always done a good job, but that day Chelsea insisted that Mary accidentally destroyed her father's documents. Even a fool knew that it was all a farce.\n\nSydney was a freshman that year and Chelsea was a sophomore.\n\nAt the Quill City Fine Arts Academy, Chelsea had always been the most sought-after goddess by many in the school. After Sydney entered the school, she stole Chelsea\u2019s glory.\n\nJealousy was written all over Chelsea's innocent face.\n\nChelsea took those humiliating photos and made Sydney look cheap. Soon, other people's harsh words tormented her as well.\n\nSydney, you are so pretty. If You planned turns a resentful woman,would your grandma still need to be a cleaner in her old age to support the family?\n\n\"Sydney! Hey, Sydney!\"\n\nXavier's words pulled her back from her thoughts.\n\nShe turned her head blankly to be met with a pair of gentle, concerned eyes.\n\nXavier saw her motionless and thought she had died with her eyes wide open.\n\nThe speed of the car was fast, and the pressure on her back felt comfortable. Sydney took the pills earlier and felt better because her discomfort was suppressed. Her ears still hurt but she could hear clearly.\n\n\"Xavier, thank you.\"\n\nXavier breathed out, \"As long as you're fine.\"\n\nSydney continued to be silent.\n\nIt was already four o'clock in the middle of the night. There were very few cars on the road.\n\nAfter Xavier turned a corner, he looked back at her.\n\nHis Adam's apple rolled quietly once more.\n\nSydney looked bright and charming from the front, but she looked even more striking with her smooth facial outline and high nose from the side. Her thick eyelashes were naturally curled; It felt like she was God\u2019s favorite.\n\nSydney stood out even among beauties and was considered stunning. She was spotted by a talent scout when she hit puberty in her first year of high school.\n\nHowever, her mother refused to allow her to enter the entertainment industry, so she had been keeping her head down at school. Initially, her mother had strict requirements. Sydney was not allowed to have long hair or wear nice clothes.\n\nThroughout high school, she had ugly short hair and wore puffy, outdated and tacky clothes. She was bullied when she started dressing up in college. It was not until she fell in love with that Black Sheep Enzo that she began to step out of her shell because she had someone to protect her.\n\nXavier broke the silence in the car again. \"You knew that all the boys have only known Lorenzo in the past three or four years. Am I right to say that you and Lorenzo have known each other for a long time?\"\n\nWith that, Sydney said, \"Yeah, he was my first love. I dated him when I was a freshman. He stayed with me throughout my college days for four years. We broke up when I graduated...\"\n\n\"After two years of separation, the elders in our respective families crossed paths by accident, and they arranged for us to get married for some reason. I was willing to get married, but he was not.\"\n\nXavier frowned. \"Do you...love him very much?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Sydney\u2019s voice trembled again, \"He used to be... very good to me. Extremely good.\"\n\nShe was deeply caught up by their love, whereby a simple sentence could dig up those heavy and profound memories.\n\n\"I don't have a father. Lorenzo not only gave me the sense of security that a boyfriend should, but he was protective like a father.\n\n\"For every holiday, others are picked up by their parents, but Lorenzo picked me up. At every start of the school season, parents would send their kids to class, but Lorenzo would send me. The day before school started, he would help me check my luggage. He would make sure I had everything I needed. He would also secretly put money into the pockets of my clothes.\u201d\n\nSydney's tears rolled down her cheeks again as she recalled those memories.\n\nXavier tightened his grip on the steering wheel. His expression became heavy. He did not expect Lorenzo to have such a tender and considerate side.\n\nHowever, tenderness and consideration were the most fearful things in a relationship because trying to move on after a breakup was tantamount to chipping away at the bones.\n\nAfter a moment, Xavier spoke, \"You are now... relying on his past kindness to you to support your marriage.\"\n\nThis sentence summed up her lonely married life for the past two years. Sydney lifted her hand and wiped her eyes, \"I am not willing to lose him. We were so good together; I really can't accept the current situation...\"\n   \n\nXavier said, \"But Sydney, have you ever thought about it? Many couples who have been estranged were once deeply in love in the past. You\u2019ve been tormenting yourself by living in the past. You will definitely meet a man who treats you better in the future.\"\n\nSydney sobbed, \"I tried moving on, but I still can't get over...\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows and changed his approach. \"Chelsea hit you, but he took Chelsea away without concern for you. Can you bear it?\"\n\nSydney was stunned for a moment. The hidden deep affection in her eyes was immediately replaced by hatred as her emotions flared up.\n\n\"No, I told Lorenzo from the start that anyone who is friends with Chelsea is my enemy. Did Lorenzo really have feelings for Chelsea, or did he do it deliberately to spite me...\n\n\"No, I can't think like that either,\" she began to mumble through her chaotic thoughts, \"No matter what his purpose is, if he really slept with Chelsea...\"\n\nShe did not continue, but closed her eyes and began to take deep breaths.\n\nSome scenes were just fantasies, but enough to suffocate her.\n\nXavier's heart ached a little when he saw Sydney in pain. At the same time, he was also curious about what happened between Sydney and Chelsea.\n\nJust as he was about to ask, his cell phone, which he had thrown inside the armrest storage, rang.\n\nHe looked down. It was a call from Lorenzo.\n\nXavier frowned, turned over his phone and clicked to hang up. He glanced in the rearview mirror again.\n\nBehind him was a flashy, black and red car, the world\u2019s rarest supercar. A toy owned by the richest man in Quill City.\n\nXavier looked at Sydney again. Her sobs could really melt a man's heart. He secretly gripped the steering wheel.\n\nIt was not Sydney who gave him her number first. The men, including him, noticed Lorenzo's indifference towards her, but were too captivated by her beauty, so they asked for it behind Lorenzo's back.\n\nOf course, they all found a perfect reason. They asked Sydney to leave her number, so they could contact her for business purposes.\n\nAt that time, no one dared to have filthy intentions. She was Lorenzo's legal wife, and Lorenzo was one of the most outstanding people among his friends.\n\nAside from the fact that Sydney was married, she was indeed a rare beauty. Everyone thought it was harmless to keep a beautiful woman\u2019s phone number.\n\nHowever, things were different now.\n\nHe swerved the steering wheel abruptly and turned around in the opposite direction. He accelerated to 200 miles an hour, and threw Lorenzo off his trail.\n\nChapter 0005\nXavier was driving dangerously fast, but his expression was exceptionally calm.\n\nIn addition to running several companies, he was also a part-time F2 racing driver.\n\nFor Lorenzo, the supercar was just a means of transportation, but in Xavier's hands, it was a toy. He was sure that Lorenzo would not be able to catch up.\n\nLorenzo watched Xavier's car zoom by his car like a ghost. He was stunned for a moment and quickly turned around. Two minutes later, he lost them.\n\nHe continued to call Xavier while flooring the accelerator, but still no one answered.\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier knew that he had other intentions when he ditched Lorenzo, but he dared not show it in front of Sydney right away.\n\nAfter all, she was still Lorenzo's wife. Xavier was one year younger than Lorenzo whom he regarded as his blood brother, so she was his sister-in-law, in a sense.\n\nHe took her to the hospital as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter the medical check-up to make sure there were no major problems, Xavier took Sydney back to Celestial Park after applying ice patches to her face.\n\nCelestial Park was a famous luxury residential area in Quill City. Sydney and Lorenzo bought their marital home here.\n\nAs soon as Sydney got to the bedroom, she saw Lorenzo sitting on the sofa at the end of the bed. There was a bottle of white wine on the round table next to him.\n\nSydney's eyes flashed. Without saying a word, she went to bed, lay down, and closed her eyes.\n\nA few seconds later, the man's footsteps were heard.\n\nSydney shivered. Her eyelashes became wet again.\n\nLorenzo suddenly got on the bed and pressed on her. She opened her eyes and started to push him away. \"Don't touch me...\"\n\nLorenzo paused, grabbed her collar with both hands, and tore her skirt apart.\n\nSydney's eyes widened with shock. Her screams echoed through the bedroom. \"Don't touch me with the hand you used to touch Chelsea Dune!\"\n\nLorenzo froze.\n\nSydney looked at him as tears poured down her face. \"I can have no dignity in front of you because we were dependent on each other for those four years. You provided a great deal for me, and you are also the closest person to me besides my mother and grandmother. My heart breaks for you because you were hurt by what happened back then. I can\u2019t bear to see you in deep pain every day because of me so I allow you to vent your grievances by hurting me!\n\n\u201cBut I can't share the same man with Chelsea, and I can't have the hand that touched her, touch me!!\n\n\u201cShe is the last straw of my dignity, Lorenzo!\"\n\nHowever, these words did not move Lorenzo to show any guilt.\n\nInstead, he became angrier. \"What about my last straw?\"\n\n\"I was disgusted by you too after Oliver touched you. What you do that night when we got registered?\"\n  \nSydney trembled. She choked.\n\nThat night.\n  \nHer mother and mother-in-law both wanted to seize the opportunity so that she and Lorenzo could have a child as soon as possible, so they tampered with their tea.\n\nLorenzo thought it was Sydney who Framed him.\n\n\"Why aren't you talking?\" Lorenzo's eyes were red as he stared into hers, \"Where did Xavier take you? He deliberately didn't answer my call. What did you do?\"\n\n\"Can you stop being suspicious of everyone and anyone? He took me to the hospital!\"\n\n\"Hospital?\" Lorenzo sneered, and he tightened his grip on her clothes, this time tearing her skirt all the way, \"Sydney, lift your legs for me!\"\n\nSydney panicked. \"What are you going to do?!\"\n\n\"Let's see if you betrayed me again!\"\n\nSydney immediately closed her knees together, \"I didn't!\"\n\nLorenzo pressed harder and his voice became more forceful, \"I don't believe a word you said!\"\n\nSuch stubborn words made Sydney lose the will to refute him.\n\nShe looked at Lorenzo\u2019s frightening and gloomy face and felt disgusted with him for the first time.\n\nShe reached out and pinched the back of his hand. \"Let me go, I'm tired, I want to sleep!\"\n\n\"I don't want to sleep, why should you sleep!\" Lorenzo was still furious. He did not seem to feel any pain in the back of his hand. The grip in his hand became stronger and stronger.\n\nHe pulled apart Sydney's knees quickly. He spread her legs apart so hard that even her behinds hurt.\n\nHe was worried that she would resist, so he pressed his knee on her belly and untied his belt.\n\nSydney's tears rolled to the side of her temples and wet the pillow. Still, she said nothing. Since pinching the back of his hand did not work, she pinched his neck hard.\n\nLorenzo winced in pain, but still did not let her go.\n\nIt felt as if he would not give up if he did not test her.\n\nLorenzo's neck,and even his arms and abdominal muscles were left bruised from Sydney's pinching while she gradually lost hope.\n\nShe wilted like dry roses, losing all trace of vitality.\n\nLorenzo endured the pain and tried to control her, but failed.\n\nSydney's tearful eyes trembled. Her hand squeezing his chest loosened, and she finally spoke again, \"Is that enough?\"\n\n\"Enough?\" Unexpectedly, Lorenzo felt even more enraged. He reached out and yanked open the drawer on the bedside table, took out the bottle of essential oil she bought, and then slammed the drawer shut!\n\nSydney seized this opportunity and tried to escape, but he grabbed her ankle in time. \"Be good!\"\n\nSydney stopped resisting. She knew she would not be able to escape tonight.\n\nShe was in tears, but she laughed. \"Lorenzo, I really didn't expect that one day I would be disgusted with you. Go ahead, disgust me more. So I can hate you enough, and give you what you want...\"\n\nShe thought, \u2018Lorenzo should know what I was referring to.\u2019\n\nIn the split second, her refusal to sign the divorce agreement suddenly wavered.\n\nDuring the time between being taken away by Xavier and being sent back home, she had been recalling the past.\n\nWhen she recalled the past with Chelsea, she did not want to lose her self-esteem. However, when she recalled every moment with Lorenzo, she did not want to regret losing the man she loved most.\n\nShe was deeply confused by these opposing feelings.\n\nHowever, right now, she actually felt disgusted with the man she loved most.\n\nShe was glad.\n\nDisgusted by him meant that she could finally let him go one day. \n\nLorenzo's face darkened at Sydney\u2019s words. He could not tell whether he was angry or something else.\n\nShe wanted to say more, but Lorenzo's lips suddenly covered hers.\n\nAt the same time, his fingertips of both hands trailed up along her waistline.\n\nThe faint smell of tobacco mixed with the fragrance and wine was an alluring masculine aroma. In the past, she could never resist his kisses.\n\nLorenzo was even wilder in the past than he is now. He was like a lion in the savanna. The passion and impulse he made her feel was strong and without restraint.\n\nApart from the four years they were separated, they had slept together for four years until now. He understood every part of her body, her preferred tension and pressure.\n\nSoon, her body reacted uncontrollably."

                      "text": "Chapter 0001\nIt was ten o'clock in the evening. Sydney Castro sat in front of the dressing table, rubbing essential oils on her body for that glowing skin.\n\nClearly, she was getting ready to please a man.\n\nHer husband, whom she had not seen for two years, was returning to Somerland today. She missed him terribly.\n\nSydney oiled every part of her body until she was soft and smooth. Then she put on a white, furry lingerie set with a cheeky little cat tail on the small of her back.\n\nIn truth, she did not have to go to such trouble in the past. Lorenzo had wished he could stick to her every day, but after that fateful day, everything changed.\n\nShe went from being his closest lover to the woman he hated the most.\n\nLater, their elders arranged for them to get married. However, Lorenzo was so reluctant that he left the country the day after signing their marriage certificate.\n\nNow two years have passed, during which he only contacted her once. It was six months after her mother's death that he sent her a divorce agreement.\n\nSydney did not sign the papers. She still harbored thoughts of rekindling her marriage with Lorenzo.\n\nHowever, it was difficult.\n\nShe was not even aware he was returning tonight. She only found out when she saw Lorenzo\u2019s friends posted about their drinking session on social media.\n\nLater, she called her mother-in-law, who helped her and sent a driver to bring Lorenzo back.\n\nThe driver called. Lorenzo would be home in a few minutes.\n\nShe had to seize this opportunity and try to rekindle their old flame again.\n\nIntentionally dressed up, she knelt on fours by the bed, evenly distributing the rose petals that had been sprinkled on the bed in advance. She was so engrossed that she did not notice a long shadow walking in.\n\nSuddenly, Sydney\u2019s cat tail was yanked hard as a hot-blooded torso pressed on her back. Her heart skipped a beat. She turned back and came face-to-face with a deep yet intense set of piercing eyes.\n\n\"Enzo...\" she began delicately, \"You finally came...\" Back.\n\nThe rest of her sentence was choked back by a kiss reeking of ethanol.\n\nSydney's eyelashes fluttered as her body responded to his. She was not sure whether Lorenzo was drunk or if her outfit tonight was a success. \n\nLorenzo kissed her so passionately that he wanted to suck her lips swollen. He placed his hands over her waist , grabbing them vigorously.\n\nThe man seemed satisfied. While taking a breath, he growled in a whisper. \"good...\"\n\nGrowling in a whisper was considered flirting. That was Lorenzo\u2019s special habit. \n\nRecently, she had been doing yoga. Her figure was way better than two years ago. This was also a surprise for Lorenzo. His words and actions ignited the fire in her heart.\n\nHer plump waist rose and fell violently. Her rapid breath escaped her rosy lips. Her glowy, fair hands explored his waist through his custom silk shirt, caressing his hard and steamy muscles for the first time in a long time. She hurriedly unbuttoned his shirt.\n\nThe smooth material slid down his strong arms. She unbuckled his belt and wrapped her legs around his waist.\n\nEight years of familiarity with each other made them very compatible in bed. No need for any fluff, they went straight into it.\n\nPerhaps it was because they had not seen each other for too long. His desire seemed to be even more intense than hers, just like when he first tasted the forbidden fruit eight years ago. The man was excited and tireless.\n\nThis went on for more than three hours. Finally, he was satisfied.\n\nSydney laid on the man's beautiful sculpted chest and kissed his handsome face obsessively, trying to make up for lost time.\n\nLorenzo kept his eyes closed, allowing her kisses.\n\n \"I'm very pleased with you tonight.\"Lorenzo said\n\nSydney smiled and kissed the corner of his lips again.\n\nLorenzo raised the corners of his lips. He grabbed her waist hard, and turned over to hold her down.\n\nSydney was sure that he was in a good mood now.\n\nShe stretched out her hand to rub his Adam's apple. Right before they did it again, she said bluntly, \"Enzo, four years ago\u2026I swear nothing happened between Oliver and I. My body and soul completely belong to you. You are finally back. Can we please forget what happened that day and move forward together?\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the smile on the man's face froze instantly.\n\nLorenzo raised his hand and grabbed Sydney\u2019s throat. \n\nSydney's heart skipped a beat. She widened her eyes in panic. It was over. She had said the wrong thing.\n\nThis happened twice before. If she mentioned the words \"four years ago\", Lorenzo would immediately become ruthless and sinister.\n\nHer best friend once said that Lorenzo's reaction was akin to PTSD, a post-traumatic stress reaction.\n\nShe had doubts at the time, and it turned out to be the same today, which proved that her best friend was right.\n\nIn a daze, she heard Lorenzo say, \"Move forward with me? You?\n\n\"I touched you tonight because I'm afraid that you,  wouldn\u2019t change your disgusting habit and sleep with my friends again!\"\n\n\"I won't, I didn\u2019t...\" Sydney explained and reached out to touch his hand, attempting to soothe him.\n\nLorenzo's hand tightened, \"Don't touch me!\"\n\nSydney's face was red from Lorenzo\u2019s grip on her throat.\n\nLorenzo took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. \"You'd better sign the divorce agreement as soon as possible. The past love we had will never be rekindled.\"\n\n The words \u2018divorce agreement\u2019 stabbed Sydney\u2019s heart like a sword. She looked up anxiously, and said with difficulty, \"We were so good back then. Are you going to completely deny all that I\u2019ve done for you, just because of that incident?\n\n\"Oliver and I both explained back then that nothing happened to us. We were set up!\"\n\nHowever, the more she explained, the angrier Lorenzo became. His hand went up her neck and grabbed her chin. The force in his grip became stronger and stronger. Sydney could feel that he wanted to crush her chin.\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\nHe ignored her cries of pain.\n\n\"Set up? Lying on the same bed with him might be a set up, but what about the child in your belly?\"\n\n\"Sydney, I wanted so badly for that baby to be mine at that time... But all the hospitals we went to in Quill City showed the same result: You were fifteen days conceived a baby.!\n\n\"I was on a business trip for two months and you were fifteen days conceived a baby. How could you make me believe that nothing happened between you and him?!\"\n\nAfter that, Lorenzo shook her off.\n\nSydney fell on the pillow. She straightened her messy hair, stood up again and explained shakily, \"But the first doctor I consulted was a traditional medicine practitioner. The old doctor said that I was two months conceived a baby. I didn't tell you immediately because I wanted to wait for you to come back to give you a surprise!\n\n\"You\u2019ve met that old doctor too. He showed you the prescription he gave me with the time written on it. Why won't you...\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Lorenzo interrupted her, \"Handwritten time has no credibility, and it's easier to bribe an old traditional medicine practitioner. Stop now and shut up!\"\n\nShe stood in his shoes and could understand the hurt in his heart. However, she still felt heartbroken from how he decisively shunned her.\n\nEspecially their child. The rejection was heartbreakingly painful.\n\nShe knew it was useless to say anything, so she kept quiet and shed tears of frustration.\n\nLorenzo got out of bed and made a phone call.\n\nThe room was quiet. As the call connected, Sydney heard the voice on the other end. She quickly got out of bed.\n\nA woman\u2019s voice. \"Mr. Bailey\u2026\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"Are you still here?\"\n\nWoman, \"Yes, do you want to come over?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lorenzo said and hung up the phone. \n\nSydney held him back. Her eyes widened with tears and her voice trembled. \"Are you seeing someone else?\"\n\nChapter 0002\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\nSydney\u2019s world collapsed as she burst into tears. \"When did it happen?! Who is she?!\"\n\nShe looked utterly miserable now. Lorenzo had no mercy, he might have even felt a little pleasure seeing her in pain.\n\n\"Can\u2019t stand seeing me with someone else?\"\n\nYes, she could not stand it.\n\nLoving a person would inherently make one possessive. Lorenzo meant so much to her that she could not accept losing him.\n\nAt this moment, the way she was just speechlessly hyperventilating due to the blow was more pathetic than crying. It felt like she was falling to pieces.\n\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He got dressed and left the bedroom.\n\nSydney refused to give up and chased after him. \"Why won\u2019t you believe that I was set up?\"\n\nLorenzo stopped and turned around. \"Then tell me, who set you up?\"\n\nThe corridor of the mansion was wide and long. Sydney was speechless as she looked at the lanky man in white shirt and trousers.    \n\nFour years ago, they talked about this many times. Each time they got stuck here.\n\nExactly.\n\nShe still did not find out who did it.\n\nThe setup was extremely vicious.\n\nLorenzo and Sydney\u2019s relationship turned from true love to pure hatred. They were so miserable for each other that it broke apart Lorenzo and Oliver\u2019s friendship. It also caused Sydney to become mentally ill, miscarrying from extreme heartache...\n\nHowever, she still could not identify the mastermind behind this! Four years ago, Sydney and Oliver searched for a long time but to no avail.\n\nLorenzo left.\n\nSydney stood in the corridor for a long time. She clutched her chest and raced towards the room at the corner of the corridor, calling out with each step, \"Mrs. Harper...\"\n\nHer breath became shorter each time.\n\nWhen she reached the door, she reached out and knocked, then her vision went dark as she fell to the ground unconscious.\n\nThe door opened shortly. The nanny had the shock of her life and quickly picked Sydney up in panic. \"Madam!\"\n\nThe sound of a car driving away was heard downstairs.\n\nSydney regained consciousness after Mrs. Harper gave her first aid.\n\nMrs. Harper had a glass of water and a handful of white pills in her hand. She said, \"Madam, why don't you tell your husband about your condition? If he sympathizes with you because of this, you might...\"\n\nSydney shook her head stubbornly, \"He and I are together because we love each other. I don't want to be pitied.\"\n\nShe took the pills and swallowed them. She closed her eyes and kept silent for a long time, then she said to Mrs. Harper, \"He\u2019s seeing someone else. I want to know who she is. Tell me, is it okay for me to ask his friends?\"\n\n\u2026\n\nMelon, the largest nightclub in Quill City.\n\nMusic was blaring in a VIP room. Lorenzo kicked the door open and went in. The men who were dancing intimately with the women almost soiled their pants.\n\nHowever, no one dared to be angry.\n\nLorenzo was a peculiar legend in Quill City. In his youth, he was an uncivilized and rebellious devil. Despite being a member of the Bailey Group, the wealthiest corporation in Quill City, he was cast out as the black sheep of the family and was dead broke.\n\nLater, his parents could not stand it anymore and made a plan for him to study abroad. He refused without hesitation. Instead, he relied on the prize money he got from a gaming tournament and simply enrolled himself in a vocational school.\n\nSuch a self-destructive person suddenly changed at the age of twenty.\n\nLorenzo became extremely hard-working. He diligently went to class and hung out in the library. He would also dress up and leave the dormitory at around six o'clock every morning. He rode the bicycle for an hour to Quill City Fine Arts Academy for lectures.\n\nSome people claimed that he had fallen in love with a student from Quill City Fine Arts Academy.\n\nNot long after, he wanted to start a company. His family was not supportive, of course. So, he put a knife to Grandpa Bailey\u2019s throat and grabbed 300 million to open a jewelry company, registered as Cherr.y.\n\nAt that time, the Baileys thought that the 300 million was burned for good. However, Cherr.y turned out to be unexpectedly successful. It made ten times the profit in its second year. In the fourth year, it was listed in Newford.\n\nToday, the \u2018Black Sheep\u2019 was a self-made man and had become the heir to the Bailey Group. Cherr.y had become a world-renowned jewelry brand.\n\nAs soon as Lorenzo sat down on the sofa, a group of beauties quickly came over and said, \"Mr. Bailey!\"\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nThe women trembled in fright and scurried away. Two more men sat down and said, \"Lorenzo, what pissed you off at home?\"\n\nLorenzo kept quiet. He picked up a glass and started chugging.\n\nThe others did not say anything anymore. They picked up their glass to drink with him.\n\nNot a moment later, someone's cell phone rang on the table.\n\n\"Xavier, your phone!\"\n\nA handsome man with platinum blond hair sat up on the sofa in a dark hidden corner.\n\nXavier woke up from his nap and scratched his tattooed neck. He took a look at his cell phone and his eyes widened.\n\n\"Lorenzo,\" he looked at Lorenzo, \"Why is Sydney calling me?\"\n\nLorenzo paused mid-drink and looked at Xavier. \"Who?\"\n\nXavier walked up to him with his cell phone, \"Your wife!\"\n\nLorenzo's expression turned sinister. \"When did you get her number?\"\n\nXavier said casually, \"On the day you both got married, I gave her my number when we sang together in the karaoke bar.\"\n\nHearing that, Lorenzo stood up abruptly and grabbed Xavier's collar, \"Who asked you to give your number?\"\n\nXavier frowned, puzzled at his friend\u2019s sudden rage. He pushed Lorenzo's hand away, \"We were all having fun, what\u2019s the big deal in exchanging contact information?\"\n\nLorenzo got angry. \"WHY\"\n\nWith that, he punched the undefended Xavier.\n\nXavier was caught off guard and slammed onto the marble table. The wine and glasses on the table clattered onto the floor.\n\nThe atmosphere froze. Lorenzo's eyes turned red like a furious beast. He growled, \"Delete her number!\"\n\nXavier was no sitting duck either. He was the second generation of the Altmans, an old money family in Quill City.  He was the prodigal son of the Altmans, a notorious troublemaker. He could hang out frequently with Lorenzo because they were similar.\n\nXavier wiped the bleeding corner of his lips and punched Lorenzo in return. \"What's going on, Popeye? Use your words, not your fists!\"\n\nLorenzo was hit on the head. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then he grabbed Xavier, pressed him on the sofa and beat him in a frenzy. \"How many times have you contacted Sydney in the past two years?!!\"\n\nXavier dodged Lorenzo's heavy punches and said, \"Why would I contact your wife like I have nothing else to do?! Have you gone mad? I'll admit you to the mental hospital!\"\n\nThese words seemed to hit a nerve. Lorenzo paused. \n\nHe was stunned for a few seconds. Then, he sat down on the side and then closed his eyes to quell the anger in his heart.\n\nXavier sat up, frowned and rubbed his shoulders. Vulgarities spewed.\n\nLorenzo ignored Xavier. After a while, he calmed down. He opened his eagle eyes and scanned the other men in the room, \"Who else saved her number?\"\n\nImmediately, several men lowered their heads to look for their phones.\n\nLorenzo was startled.\n\nImmediately, terrifying sounds of broken bottles filled the space, as well as Lorenzo's angry swear words, and screams of women as they dodge shards of glass.\n\nLorenzo seemed to have lost his mind and started attacking all his friends.\n\nXavier stepped outside with his cell phone and returned Sydney\u2019s call.\n\nWhen Sydney picked up, Xavier humbly said, \"Hi, Sydney. What's the matter?\"\n\nSydney's voice was gentle and polite. \"Xavier, I'm sorry to bother you. Lorenzo got a little upset with me tonight. He blocked me and I can't contact him. I wanted to ask if you know where he is.\"\n\nChapter 0003\n\"He was drinking with me, and now he's drunk and acting crazy. I'll send him back to you later. Don\u2019t worry.\"\n\nSydney paused for a moment then said, \"Can you give me the address? I want to check on him myself.\"\n\nXavier took a deep breath, opened the door and saw the chaos inside. He said, \"Melon, A.\"\n\nAbout ten minutes later, apart from Lorenzo and Xavier, everyone else left.\n\nLorenzo sat on the sofa. He stared at the chandelier on the ceiling, lost in thoughts.\n\nXavier sat next to him, \"We are not a part of your drama with Sydney. If anything, go home and solve it with her. Don't go crazy here.\"\n\nLorenzo closed his eyes. \"I\u2019m not going home.\"\n\n\"You must,\" \"Then tell me what happened between you two, I\u2019ll find a way for you.\"\n\nLorenzo, \"You can't.\"\n\n\u201cFine,\" Xavier said, \"If you won't go home, where will you go later?\"\n\n\"Chelsea will pick me up.\"\n\nXavier was stunned for a moment. \"Are you okay? You got so anxious when your wife called me. And now you\u2019re going to see another woman?\n\n\"I met you late. I don't know what happened between you and Sydney. You left her alone for two years, acting like you really don't care. However, we are not allowed to keep her contact information. What on earth are you thinking?\"\n\nLorenzo became impatient again. \"Boy, don\u2019t meddle with adult matters.\"\n\nWhen Xavier started to curse, a creaking sound came from the door. The two of them looked towards the door.\n\n\u201cEnzo,\u201d A sweet voice came.\n\nThe woman had the body of a devil and the face of an angel as she slithered in. She was the \u2018Nation\u2019s Goddess\u2019 and top tier actress, Chelsea Dune.\n \nLorenzo's expression finally softened a little when she appeared. \"Here she comes.\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows subtly.\n\nChelsea elegantly sat next to Lorenzo while avoiding the mess on the ground. She saw the cut at the corner of his eye.\n\nThe woman frowned. \"Why are you hurt?\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"It's nothing. I just drank too much.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt?\" As she spoke, Chelsea reached out and took Lorenzo's arm.\n\nXavier said with a smile, \"Hey Superstar, do you know he is married?\"\n\nChelsea paused and retracted her hand in embarrassment. \"Enzo and I are just friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, cool.\"\n\nLorenzo seemed displeased with Xavier's sarcasm towards Chelsea. He retorted, \"What are you trying to say?\"\n\nXavier stuck his tongue in his cheek and stood up with a grin. \"Nothing. Things among you guys are too complicated for my little brain. I\u2019m gonna go home to bed.\"\n\nAs soon as Xavier reached the door, the door was opened from the outside.\n\nXavier paused.\n\nSydney stood timidly at the door.\n\nShe was timid but she was objectively eye-catching.\n\nHer long, dark and wavy hair draped casually down her back. She had light makeup on her delicate and pretty face. Her lips were as bright as cherry, with a hint of sparkle.\n\nThe velvet, burgundy strappy dress contrasted with her flawless, snow-white skin. She was like a blooming red rose in the dark night.\n\nXavier gulped. He forgot how to speak at that moment.\n\nLorenzo's voice was suddenly heard. \"Who\u2019s there?\"\n\nXavier was stunned,and stepped aside to make way for Sydney. After Sydney entered the room, he exhaled and came back to his senses.\n\nAs soon as Sydney reached the door, she froze.\n\nEveryone had left. The private room had the brightest lights turned on. Right in the middle, Lorenzo and Chelsea were sitting together with their arms touching each other. To Sydney, that scene hurt her eyes more than the light.\n\nHer breath was stuck in her throat. Her lips quivered, but she could not say a word.\n\nLorenzo had an affair with Chelsea, her college bully!\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Lorenzo frowned, \"Go back!\"\n\nSydney shuddered then finally took a step. She quickened her pace.\n\nShe went up to the two of them. While everyone was caught off guard, she slapped Chelsea across the face and grabbed her hair. \"It's you!\"\n\nChelsea screamed, \"Ah! Enzo, help me!\"\n\n\u201cSydney!\u201d\n\nWhen Lorenzo spoke, Sydney let go of Chelsea. She raised her hand towards Lorenzo, but did not strike him.\n\nHer hands trembled. She broke down and shouted, \"You clearly know what she did to me back then! Of all the people, why her?!\"\n\nSuddenly.\n\nSlap!\n\nChelsea took advantage when Sydney was unguarded and slapped her back. That slap was even harder than Sydney\u2019s.\n\nSydney felt ringing in her ears, and then blood dripped from the corners of her lips.\n\nChelsea snarled, \"Why blame others if you can't keep your man?!\"\n\nSydney held her face. Her eyes turned red at Chelsea\u2019s smug expression. She shouted, \"I'm taking your life. \n\nShe tried to attack Chelsea again, but Lorenzo stopped her. He grabbed the back of her head and threw her to the other side of the sofa.\n\n\"I told you to go back, are you deaf?\"\n\nSydney felt as if she had gone deaf. The ringing in her ears was so severe that she couldn't hear what Lorenzo said. Half of her head was throbbing.\n\nAt this moment, Chelsea suddenly covered her ears and wailed, \"Enzo, I can't hear!\"\n\nLorenzo was shocked, \"You can\u2019t hear?\"\n\nChelsea's eyes widened in pity, and her cries became louder. \"I can't hear what you said...\"\n\nLorenzo looked back and glared at Sydney fiercely. He stood up, arms over Chelsea and walked out, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier, saw Lorenzo escorting a tearful Chelsea out of the room. He knew something was amiss and quickly entered the room.\n\nSydney closed her eyes and clasped her head with her hands. She fell sideways on the sofa. Her shoulders shook.\n\nAt the moment, half of that bright and charming face was as pale as paper, and the other half was marked with an angry palm print. The blood on the corners of her lips stood out even more.\n\nXavier's eyes widened and he rushed over. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney did not respond.\n\nXavier nudged her gently. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney then opened her eyes, her voice fading away, \"My, my ears hurt...\"\n\nWith the slap mark and her ear hurting, Xavier immediately understood what had happened. He helped Sydney up and said, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\nSydney only managed to take two steps before her legs gave way. She was about to crash.\n\nPeople lose strength when they cannot bear the pain. Sydney would rather die than have Lorenzo cheated on her with Chelsea.\n\nXavier felt a pang of distress. He carried Sydney in his arms and hurried out.\n\n\u2026\n\nLorenzo and Chelsea stopped outside the main entrance of Melon. He said, \"Wait for me here, I'll get the car.\"\n\nChelsea held him and said, \"Enzo, I'm better now. I don\u2019t think I need to go to the hospital. Come with me and stay with me, okay?\"\n\nLorenzo frowned, and just as he was about to agree, something behind Chelsea attracted his attention.\n\nXavier carried Sydney and walked quickly towards the parking lot.\n\nLorenzo frowned, \"Since you don't need to go to the hospital, you should go back to the hotel first.\"\n\nWith that, he turned to chase after Xavier, but Chelsea pulled him back. \"Are you going to look for Sydney? How could she treat you like that but you still can't let her go?\"\n\nChapter 0004\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He did not answer and strode after Xavier.\n\nChelsea exhaled forcefully. Her shoulders trembled. She looked at Sydney and Xavier with clear hatred and jealousy.\n\nHowever, Lorenzo did not manage to intercept Xavier. When he passed by, Xavier's car drifted gorgeously before merging onto the main freeway.\n\n\u2026\n\nInside the car.\n\nSydney crumpled into a ball and leaned against the car window. Xavier fastened the seat belt for her.\n\nTears streamed down her face the whole time, but she was expressionless, like a soulless sculpture.\n\nThe pain in her ear strained the nerves across her head, and pulled out many memories that she did not want to recall.\n\nA group of heavily made-up girls surrounded her. The proudest one leading the pack, was Chelsea, the one with the harmless face.\n\nHer smile was pure evil. She pulled Sydney\u2019s hair, and let her companions take turns to slap her. Chelsea dripped melted white ice cream on Sydney\u2019s face and chest.\n\nSydney dared not resist because her grandmother, Mary Collins, was in the hands of Christopher, Chelsea's father.\n\nThe Dunes were quite wealthy. Christopher owned a ceramics company, and Mary used to work as a cleaner in Christopher\u2019s office building.\n\nMary had always done a good job, but that day Chelsea insisted that Mary accidentally destroyed her father's documents. Even a fool knew that it was all a farce.\n\nSydney was a freshman that year and Chelsea was a sophomore.\n\nAt the Quill City Fine Arts Academy, Chelsea had always been the most sought-after goddess by many in the school. After Sydney entered the school, she stole Chelsea\u2019s glory.\n\nJealousy was written all over Chelsea's innocent face.\n\nChelsea took those humiliating photos and made Sydney look cheap. Soon, other people's harsh words tormented her as well.\n\nSydney, you are so pretty. If You planned turns a resentful woman,would your grandma still need to be a cleaner in her old age to support the family?\n\n\"Sydney! Hey, Sydney!\"\n\nXavier's words pulled her back from her thoughts.\n\nShe turned her head blankly to be met with a pair of gentle, concerned eyes.\n\nXavier saw her motionless and thought she had died with her eyes wide open.\n\nThe speed of the car was fast, and the pressure on her back felt comfortable. Sydney took the pills earlier and felt better because her discomfort was suppressed. Her ears still hurt but she could hear clearly.\n\n\"Xavier, thank you.\"\n\nXavier breathed out, \"As long as you're fine.\"\n\nSydney continued to be silent.\n\nIt was already four o'clock in the middle of the night. There were very few cars on the road.\n\nAfter Xavier turned a corner, he looked back at her.\n\nHis Adam's apple rolled quietly once more.\n\nSydney looked bright and charming from the front, but she looked even more striking with her smooth facial outline and high nose from the side. Her thick eyelashes were naturally curled; It felt like she was God\u2019s favorite.\n\nSydney stood out even among beauties and was considered stunning. She was spotted by a talent scout when she hit puberty in her first year of high school.\n\nHowever, her mother refused to allow her to enter the entertainment industry, so she had been keeping her head down at school. Initially, her mother had strict requirements. Sydney was not allowed to have long hair or wear nice clothes.\n\nThroughout high school, she had ugly short hair and wore puffy, outdated and tacky clothes. She was bullied when she started dressing up in college. It was not until she fell in love with that Black Sheep Enzo that she began to step out of her shell because she had someone to protect her.\n\nXavier broke the silence in the car again. \"You knew that all the boys have only known Lorenzo in the past three or four years. Am I right to say that you and Lorenzo have known each other for a long time?\"\n\nWith that, Sydney said, \"Yeah, he was my first love. I dated him when I was a freshman. He stayed with me throughout my college days for four years. We broke up when I graduated...\"\n\n\"After two years of separation, the elders in our respective families crossed paths by accident, and they arranged for us to get married for some reason. I was willing to get married, but he was not.\"\n\nXavier frowned. \"Do you...love him very much?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Sydney\u2019s voice trembled again, \"He used to be... very good to me. Extremely good.\"\n\nShe was deeply caught up by their love, whereby a simple sentence could dig up those heavy and profound memories.\n\n\"I don't have a father. Lorenzo not only gave me the sense of security that a boyfriend should, but he was protective like a father.\n\n\"For every holiday, others are picked up by their parents, but Lorenzo picked me up. At every start of the school season, parents would send their kids to class, but Lorenzo would send me. The day before school started, he would help me check my luggage. He would make sure I had everything I needed. He would also secretly put money into the pockets of my clothes.\u201d\n\nSydney's tears rolled down her cheeks again as she recalled those memories.\n\nXavier tightened his grip on the steering wheel. His expression became heavy. He did not expect Lorenzo to have such a tender and considerate side.\n\nHowever, tenderness and consideration were the most fearful things in a relationship because trying to move on after a breakup was tantamount to chipping away at the bones.\n\nAfter a moment, Xavier spoke, \"You are now... relying on his past kindness to you to support your marriage.\"\n\nThis sentence summed up her lonely married life for the past two years. Sydney lifted her hand and wiped her eyes, \"I am not willing to lose him. We were so good together; I really can't accept the current situation...\"\n   \n\nXavier said, \"But Sydney, have you ever thought about it? Many couples who have been estranged were once deeply in love in the past. You\u2019ve been tormenting yourself by living in the past. You will definitely meet a man who treats you better in the future.\"\n\nSydney sobbed, \"I tried moving on, but I still can't get over...\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows and changed his approach. \"Chelsea hit you, but he took Chelsea away without concern for you. Can you bear it?\"\n\nSydney was stunned for a moment. The hidden deep affection in her eyes was immediately replaced by hatred as her emotions flared up.\n\n\"No, I told Lorenzo from the start that anyone who is friends with Chelsea is my enemy. Did Lorenzo really have feelings for Chelsea, or did he do it deliberately to spite me...\n\n\"No, I can't think like that either,\" she began to mumble through her chaotic thoughts, \"No matter what his purpose is, if he really slept with Chelsea...\"\n\nShe did not continue, but closed her eyes and began to take deep breaths.\n\nSome scenes were just fantasies, but enough to suffocate her.\n\nXavier's heart ached a little when he saw Sydney in pain. At the same time, he was also curious about what happened between Sydney and Chelsea.\n\nJust as he was about to ask, his cell phone, which he had thrown inside the armrest storage, rang.\n\nHe looked down. It was a call from Lorenzo.\n\nXavier frowned, turned over his phone and clicked to hang up. He glanced in the rearview mirror again.\n\nBehind him was a flashy, black and red car, the world\u2019s rarest supercar. A toy owned by the richest man in Quill City.\n\nXavier looked at Sydney again. Her sobs could really melt a man's heart. He secretly gripped the steering wheel.\n\nIt was not Sydney who gave him her number first. The men, including him, noticed Lorenzo's indifference towards her, but were too captivated by her beauty, so they asked for it behind Lorenzo's back.\n\nOf course, they all found a perfect reason. They asked Sydney to leave her number, so they could contact her for business purposes.\n\nAt that time, no one dared to have filthy intentions. She was Lorenzo's legal wife, and Lorenzo was one of the most outstanding people among his friends.\n\nAside from the fact that Sydney was married, she was indeed a rare beauty. Everyone thought it was harmless to keep a beautiful woman\u2019s phone number.\n\nHowever, things were different now.\n\nHe swerved the steering wheel abruptly and turned around in the opposite direction. He accelerated to 200 miles an hour, and threw Lorenzo off his trail.\n\nChapter 0005\nXavier was driving dangerously fast, but his expression was exceptionally calm.\n\nIn addition to running several companies, he was also a part-time F2 racing driver.\n\nFor Lorenzo, the supercar was just a means of transportation, but in Xavier's hands, it was a toy. He was sure that Lorenzo would not be able to catch up.\n\nLorenzo watched Xavier's car zoom by his car like a ghost. He was stunned for a moment and quickly turned around. Two minutes later, he lost them.\n\nHe continued to call Xavier while flooring the accelerator, but still no one answered.\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier knew that he had other intentions when he ditched Lorenzo, but he dared not show it in front of Sydney right away.\n\nAfter all, she was still Lorenzo's wife. Xavier was one year younger than Lorenzo whom he regarded as his blood brother, so she was his sister-in-law, in a sense.\n\nHe took her to the hospital as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter the medical check-up to make sure there were no major problems, Xavier took Sydney back to Celestial Park after applying ice patches to her face.\n\nCelestial Park was a famous luxury residential area in Quill City. Sydney and Lorenzo bought their marital home here.\n\nAs soon as Sydney got to the bedroom, she saw Lorenzo sitting on the sofa at the end of the bed. There was a bottle of white wine on the round table next to him.\n\nSydney's eyes flashed. Without saying a word, she went to bed, lay down, and closed her eyes.\n\nA few seconds later, the man's footsteps were heard.\n\nSydney shivered. Her eyelashes became wet again.\n\nLorenzo suddenly got on the bed and pressed on her. She opened her eyes and started to push him away. \"Don't touch me...\"\n\nLorenzo paused, grabbed her collar with both hands, and tore her skirt apart.\n\nSydney's eyes widened with shock. Her screams echoed through the bedroom. \"Don't touch me with the hand you used to touch Chelsea Dune!\"\n\nLorenzo froze.\n\nSydney looked at him as tears poured down her face. \"I can have no dignity in front of you because we were dependent on each other for those four years. You provided a great deal for me, and you are also the closest person to me besides my mother and grandmother. My heart breaks for you because you were hurt by what happened back then. I can\u2019t bear to see you in deep pain every day because of me so I allow you to vent your grievances by hurting me!\n\n\u201cBut I can't share the same man with Chelsea, and I can't have the hand that touched her, touch me!!\n\n\u201cShe is the last straw of my dignity, Lorenzo!\"\n\nHowever, these words did not move Lorenzo to show any guilt.\n\nInstead, he became angrier. \"What about my last straw?\"\n\n\"I was disgusted by you too after Oliver touched you. What you do that night when we got registered?\"\n  \nSydney trembled. She choked.\n\nThat night.\n  \nHer mother and mother-in-law both wanted to seize the opportunity so that she and Lorenzo could have a child as soon as possible, so they tampered with their tea.\n\nLorenzo thought it was Sydney who Framed him.\n\n\"Why aren't you talking?\" Lorenzo's eyes were red as he stared into hers, \"Where did Xavier take you? He deliberately didn't answer my call. What did you do?\"\n\n\"Can you stop being suspicious of everyone and anyone? He took me to the hospital!\"\n\n\"Hospital?\" Lorenzo sneered, and he tightened his grip on her clothes, this time tearing her skirt all the way, \"Sydney, lift your legs for me!\"\n\nSydney panicked. \"What are you going to do?!\"\n\n\"Let's see if you betrayed me again!\"\n\nSydney immediately closed her knees together, \"I didn't!\"\n\nLorenzo pressed harder and his voice became more forceful, \"I don't believe a word you said!\"\n\nSuch stubborn words made Sydney lose the will to refute him.\n\nShe looked at Lorenzo\u2019s frightening and gloomy face and felt disgusted with him for the first time.\n\nShe reached out and pinched the back of his hand. \"Let me go, I'm tired, I want to sleep!\"\n\n\"I don't want to sleep, why should you sleep!\" Lorenzo was still furious. He did not seem to feel any pain in the back of his hand. The grip in his hand became stronger and stronger.\n\nHe pulled apart Sydney's knees quickly. He spread her legs apart so hard that even her behinds hurt.\n\nHe was worried that she would resist, so he pressed his knee on her belly and untied his belt.\n\nSydney's tears rolled to the side of her temples and wet the pillow. Still, she said nothing. Since pinching the back of his hand did not work, she pinched his neck hard.\n\nLorenzo winced in pain, but still did not let her go.\n\nIt felt as if he would not give up if he did not test her.\n\nLorenzo's neck,and even his arms and abdominal muscles were left bruised from Sydney's pinching while she gradually lost hope.\n\nShe wilted like dry roses, losing all trace of vitality.\n\nLorenzo endured the pain and tried to control her, but failed.\n\nSydney's tearful eyes trembled. Her hand squeezing his chest loosened, and she finally spoke again, \"Is that enough?\"\n\n\"Enough?\" Unexpectedly, Lorenzo felt even more enraged. He reached out and yanked open the drawer on the bedside table, took out the bottle of essential oil she bought, and then slammed the drawer shut!\n\nSydney seized this opportunity and tried to escape, but he grabbed her ankle in time. \"Be good!\"\n\nSydney stopped resisting. She knew she would not be able to escape tonight.\n\nShe was in tears, but she laughed. \"Lorenzo, I really didn't expect that one day I would be disgusted with you. Go ahead, disgust me more. So I can hate you enough, and give you what you want...\"\n\nShe thought, \u2018Lorenzo should know what I was referring to.\u2019\n\nIn the split second, her refusal to sign the divorce agreement suddenly wavered.\n\nDuring the time between being taken away by Xavier and being sent back home, she had been recalling the past.\n\nWhen she recalled the past with Chelsea, she did not want to lose her self-esteem. However, when she recalled every moment with Lorenzo, she did not want to regret losing the man she loved most.\n\nShe was deeply confused by these opposing feelings.\n\nHowever, right now, she actually felt disgusted with the man she loved most.\n\nShe was glad.\n\nDisgusted by him meant that she could finally let him go one day. \n\nLorenzo's face darkened at Sydney\u2019s words. He could not tell whether he was angry or something else.\n\nShe wanted to say more, but Lorenzo's lips suddenly covered hers.\n\nAt the same time, his fingertips of both hands trailed up along her waistline.\n\nThe faint smell of tobacco mixed with the fragrance and wine was an alluring masculine aroma. In the past, she could never resist his kisses.\n\nLorenzo was even wilder in the past than he is now. He was like a lion in the savanna. The passion and impulse he made her feel was strong and without restraint.\n\nApart from the four years they were separated, they had slept together for four years until now. He understood every part of her body, her preferred tension and pressure.\n\nSoon, her body reacted uncontrollably."

                      "text": "Chapter 0001\nIt was ten o'clock in the evening. Sydney Castro sat in front of the dressing table, rubbing essential oils on her body for that glowing skin.\n\nClearly, she was getting ready to please a man.\n\nHer husband, whom she had not seen for two years, was returning to Somerland today. She missed him terribly.\n\nSydney oiled every part of her body until she was soft and smooth. Then she put on a white, furry lingerie set with a cheeky little cat tail on the small of her back.\n\nIn truth, she did not have to go to such trouble in the past. Lorenzo had wished he could stick to her every day, but after that fateful day, everything changed.\n\nShe went from being his closest lover to the woman he hated the most.\n\nLater, their elders arranged for them to get married. However, Lorenzo was so reluctant that he left the country the day after signing their marriage certificate.\n\nNow two years have passed, during which he only contacted her once. It was six months after her mother's death that he sent her a divorce agreement.\n\nSydney did not sign the papers. She still harbored thoughts of rekindling her marriage with Lorenzo.\n\nHowever, it was difficult.\n\nShe was not even aware he was returning tonight. She only found out when she saw Lorenzo\u2019s friends posted about their drinking session on social media.\n\nLater, she called her mother-in-law, who helped her and sent a driver to bring Lorenzo back.\n\nThe driver called. Lorenzo would be home in a few minutes.\n\nShe had to seize this opportunity and try to rekindle their old flame again.\n\nIntentionally dressed up, she knelt on fours by the bed, evenly distributing the rose petals that had been sprinkled on the bed in advance. She was so engrossed that she did not notice a long shadow walking in.\n\nSuddenly, Sydney\u2019s cat tail was yanked hard as a hot-blooded torso pressed on her back. Her heart skipped a beat. She turned back and came face-to-face with a deep yet intense set of piercing eyes.\n\n\"Enzo...\" she began delicately, \"You finally came...\" Back.\n\nThe rest of her sentence was choked back by a kiss reeking of ethanol.\n\nSydney's eyelashes fluttered as her body responded to his. She was not sure whether Lorenzo was drunk or if her outfit tonight was a success. \n\nLorenzo kissed her so passionately that he wanted to suck her lips swollen. He placed his hands over her waist , grabbing them vigorously.\n\nThe man seemed satisfied. While taking a breath, he growled in a whisper. \"good...\"\n\nGrowling in a whisper was considered flirting. That was Lorenzo\u2019s special habit. \n\nRecently, she had been doing yoga. Her figure was way better than two years ago. This was also a surprise for Lorenzo. His words and actions ignited the fire in her heart.\n\nHer plump waist rose and fell violently. Her rapid breath escaped her rosy lips. Her glowy, fair hands explored his waist through his custom silk shirt, caressing his hard and steamy muscles for the first time in a long time. She hurriedly unbuttoned his shirt.\n\nThe smooth material slid down his strong arms. She unbuckled his belt and wrapped her legs around his waist.\n\nEight years of familiarity with each other made them very compatible in bed. No need for any fluff, they went straight into it.\n\nPerhaps it was because they had not seen each other for too long. His desire seemed to be even more intense than hers, just like when he first tasted the forbidden fruit eight years ago. The man was excited and tireless.\n\nThis went on for more than three hours. Finally, he was satisfied.\n\nSydney laid on the man's beautiful sculpted chest and kissed his handsome face obsessively, trying to make up for lost time.\n\nLorenzo kept his eyes closed, allowing her kisses.\n\n \"I'm very pleased with you tonight.\"Lorenzo said\n\nSydney smiled and kissed the corner of his lips again.\n\nLorenzo raised the corners of his lips. He grabbed her waist hard, and turned over to hold her down.\n\nSydney was sure that he was in a good mood now.\n\nShe stretched out her hand to rub his Adam's apple. Right before they did it again, she said bluntly, \"Enzo, four years ago\u2026I swear nothing happened between Oliver and I. My body and soul completely belong to you. You are finally back. Can we please forget what happened that day and move forward together?\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the smile on the man's face froze instantly.\n\nLorenzo raised his hand and grabbed Sydney\u2019s throat. \n\nSydney's heart skipped a beat. She widened her eyes in panic. It was over. She had said the wrong thing.\n\nThis happened twice before. If she mentioned the words \"four years ago\", Lorenzo would immediately become ruthless and sinister.\n\nHer best friend once said that Lorenzo's reaction was akin to PTSD, a post-traumatic stress reaction.\n\nShe had doubts at the time, and it turned out to be the same today, which proved that her best friend was right.\n\nIn a daze, she heard Lorenzo say, \"Move forward with me? You?\n\n\"I touched you tonight because I'm afraid that you,  wouldn\u2019t change your disgusting habit and sleep with my friends again!\"\n\n\"I won't, I didn\u2019t...\" Sydney explained and reached out to touch his hand, attempting to soothe him.\n\nLorenzo's hand tightened, \"Don't touch me!\"\n\nSydney's face was red from Lorenzo\u2019s grip on her throat.\n\nLorenzo took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. \"You'd better sign the divorce agreement as soon as possible. The past love we had will never be rekindled.\"\n\n The words \u2018divorce agreement\u2019 stabbed Sydney\u2019s heart like a sword. She looked up anxiously, and said with difficulty, \"We were so good back then. Are you going to completely deny all that I\u2019ve done for you, just because of that incident?\n\n\"Oliver and I both explained back then that nothing happened to us. We were set up!\"\n\nHowever, the more she explained, the angrier Lorenzo became. His hand went up her neck and grabbed her chin. The force in his grip became stronger and stronger. Sydney could feel that he wanted to crush her chin.\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\nHe ignored her cries of pain.\n\n\"Set up? Lying on the same bed with him might be a set up, but what about the child in your belly?\"\n\n\"Sydney, I wanted so badly for that baby to be mine at that time... But all the hospitals we went to in Quill City showed the same result: You were fifteen days conceived a baby.!\n\n\"I was on a business trip for two months and you were fifteen days conceived a baby. How could you make me believe that nothing happened between you and him?!\"\n\nAfter that, Lorenzo shook her off.\n\nSydney fell on the pillow. She straightened her messy hair, stood up again and explained shakily, \"But the first doctor I consulted was a traditional medicine practitioner. The old doctor said that I was two months conceived a baby. I didn't tell you immediately because I wanted to wait for you to come back to give you a surprise!\n\n\"You\u2019ve met that old doctor too. He showed you the prescription he gave me with the time written on it. Why won't you...\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Lorenzo interrupted her, \"Handwritten time has no credibility, and it's easier to bribe an old traditional medicine practitioner. Stop now and shut up!\"\n\nShe stood in his shoes and could understand the hurt in his heart. However, she still felt heartbroken from how he decisively shunned her.\n\nEspecially their child. The rejection was heartbreakingly painful.\n\nShe knew it was useless to say anything, so she kept quiet and shed tears of frustration.\n\nLorenzo got out of bed and made a phone call.\n\nThe room was quiet. As the call connected, Sydney heard the voice on the other end. She quickly got out of bed.\n\nA woman\u2019s voice. \"Mr. Bailey\u2026\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"Are you still here?\"\n\nWoman, \"Yes, do you want to come over?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lorenzo said and hung up the phone. \n\nSydney held him back. Her eyes widened with tears and her voice trembled. \"Are you seeing someone else?\"\n\nChapter 0002\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\nSydney\u2019s world collapsed as she burst into tears. \"When did it happen?! Who is she?!\"\n\nShe looked utterly miserable now. Lorenzo had no mercy, he might have even felt a little pleasure seeing her in pain.\n\n\"Can\u2019t stand seeing me with someone else?\"\n\nYes, she could not stand it.\n\nLoving a person would inherently make one possessive. Lorenzo meant so much to her that she could not accept losing him.\n\nAt this moment, the way she was just speechlessly hyperventilating due to the blow was more pathetic than crying. It felt like she was falling to pieces.\n\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He got dressed and left the bedroom.\n\nSydney refused to give up and chased after him. \"Why won\u2019t you believe that I was set up?\"\n\nLorenzo stopped and turned around. \"Then tell me, who set you up?\"\n\nThe corridor of the mansion was wide and long. Sydney was speechless as she looked at the lanky man in white shirt and trousers.    \n\nFour years ago, they talked about this many times. Each time they got stuck here.\n\nExactly.\n\nShe still did not find out who did it.\n\nThe setup was extremely vicious.\n\nLorenzo and Sydney\u2019s relationship turned from true love to pure hatred. They were so miserable for each other that it broke apart Lorenzo and Oliver\u2019s friendship. It also caused Sydney to become mentally ill, miscarrying from extreme heartache...\n\nHowever, she still could not identify the mastermind behind this! Four years ago, Sydney and Oliver searched for a long time but to no avail.\n\nLorenzo left.\n\nSydney stood in the corridor for a long time. She clutched her chest and raced towards the room at the corner of the corridor, calling out with each step, \"Mrs. Harper...\"\n\nHer breath became shorter each time.\n\nWhen she reached the door, she reached out and knocked, then her vision went dark as she fell to the ground unconscious.\n\nThe door opened shortly. The nanny had the shock of her life and quickly picked Sydney up in panic. \"Madam!\"\n\nThe sound of a car driving away was heard downstairs.\n\nSydney regained consciousness after Mrs. Harper gave her first aid.\n\nMrs. Harper had a glass of water and a handful of white pills in her hand. She said, \"Madam, why don't you tell your husband about your condition? If he sympathizes with you because of this, you might...\"\n\nSydney shook her head stubbornly, \"He and I are together because we love each other. I don't want to be pitied.\"\n\nShe took the pills and swallowed them. She closed her eyes and kept silent for a long time, then she said to Mrs. Harper, \"He\u2019s seeing someone else. I want to know who she is. Tell me, is it okay for me to ask his friends?\"\n\n\u2026\n\nMelon, the largest nightclub in Quill City.\n\nMusic was blaring in a VIP room. Lorenzo kicked the door open and went in. The men who were dancing intimately with the women almost soiled their pants.\n\nHowever, no one dared to be angry.\n\nLorenzo was a peculiar legend in Quill City. In his youth, he was an uncivilized and rebellious devil. Despite being a member of the Bailey Group, the wealthiest corporation in Quill City, he was cast out as the black sheep of the family and was dead broke.\n\nLater, his parents could not stand it anymore and made a plan for him to study abroad. He refused without hesitation. Instead, he relied on the prize money he got from a gaming tournament and simply enrolled himself in a vocational school.\n\nSuch a self-destructive person suddenly changed at the age of twenty.\n\nLorenzo became extremely hard-working. He diligently went to class and hung out in the library. He would also dress up and leave the dormitory at around six o'clock every morning. He rode the bicycle for an hour to Quill City Fine Arts Academy for lectures.\n\nSome people claimed that he had fallen in love with a student from Quill City Fine Arts Academy.\n\nNot long after, he wanted to start a company. His family was not supportive, of course. So, he put a knife to Grandpa Bailey\u2019s throat and grabbed 300 million to open a jewelry company, registered as Cherr.y.\n\nAt that time, the Baileys thought that the 300 million was burned for good. However, Cherr.y turned out to be unexpectedly successful. It made ten times the profit in its second year. In the fourth year, it was listed in Newford.\n\nToday, the \u2018Black Sheep\u2019 was a self-made man and had become the heir to the Bailey Group. Cherr.y had become a world-renowned jewelry brand.\n\nAs soon as Lorenzo sat down on the sofa, a group of beauties quickly came over and said, \"Mr. Bailey!\"\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nThe women trembled in fright and scurried away. Two more men sat down and said, \"Lorenzo, what pissed you off at home?\"\n\nLorenzo kept quiet. He picked up a glass and started chugging.\n\nThe others did not say anything anymore. They picked up their glass to drink with him.\n\nNot a moment later, someone's cell phone rang on the table.\n\n\"Xavier, your phone!\"\n\nA handsome man with platinum blond hair sat up on the sofa in a dark hidden corner.\n\nXavier woke up from his nap and scratched his tattooed neck. He took a look at his cell phone and his eyes widened.\n\n\"Lorenzo,\" he looked at Lorenzo, \"Why is Sydney calling me?\"\n\nLorenzo paused mid-drink and looked at Xavier. \"Who?\"\n\nXavier walked up to him with his cell phone, \"Your wife!\"\n\nLorenzo's expression turned sinister. \"When did you get her number?\"\n\nXavier said casually, \"On the day you both got married, I gave her my number when we sang together in the karaoke bar.\"\n\nHearing that, Lorenzo stood up abruptly and grabbed Xavier's collar, \"Who asked you to give your number?\"\n\nXavier frowned, puzzled at his friend\u2019s sudden rage. He pushed Lorenzo's hand away, \"We were all having fun, what\u2019s the big deal in exchanging contact information?\"\n\nLorenzo got angry. \"WHY\"\n\nWith that, he punched the undefended Xavier.\n\nXavier was caught off guard and slammed onto the marble table. The wine and glasses on the table clattered onto the floor.\n\nThe atmosphere froze. Lorenzo's eyes turned red like a furious beast. He growled, \"Delete her number!\"\n\nXavier was no sitting duck either. He was the second generation of the Altmans, an old money family in Quill City.  He was the prodigal son of the Altmans, a notorious troublemaker. He could hang out frequently with Lorenzo because they were similar.\n\nXavier wiped the bleeding corner of his lips and punched Lorenzo in return. \"What's going on, Popeye? Use your words, not your fists!\"\n\nLorenzo was hit on the head. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then he grabbed Xavier, pressed him on the sofa and beat him in a frenzy. \"How many times have you contacted Sydney in the past two years?!!\"\n\nXavier dodged Lorenzo's heavy punches and said, \"Why would I contact your wife like I have nothing else to do?! Have you gone mad? I'll admit you to the mental hospital!\"\n\nThese words seemed to hit a nerve. Lorenzo paused. \n\nHe was stunned for a few seconds. Then, he sat down on the side and then closed his eyes to quell the anger in his heart.\n\nXavier sat up, frowned and rubbed his shoulders. Vulgarities spewed.\n\nLorenzo ignored Xavier. After a while, he calmed down. He opened his eagle eyes and scanned the other men in the room, \"Who else saved her number?\"\n\nImmediately, several men lowered their heads to look for their phones.\n\nLorenzo was startled.\n\nImmediately, terrifying sounds of broken bottles filled the space, as well as Lorenzo's angry swear words, and screams of women as they dodge shards of glass.\n\nLorenzo seemed to have lost his mind and started attacking all his friends.\n\nXavier stepped outside with his cell phone and returned Sydney\u2019s call.\n\nWhen Sydney picked up, Xavier humbly said, \"Hi, Sydney. What's the matter?\"\n\nSydney's voice was gentle and polite. \"Xavier, I'm sorry to bother you. Lorenzo got a little upset with me tonight. He blocked me and I can't contact him. I wanted to ask if you know where he is.\"\n\nChapter 0003\n\"He was drinking with me, and now he's drunk and acting crazy. I'll send him back to you later. Don\u2019t worry.\"\n\nSydney paused for a moment then said, \"Can you give me the address? I want to check on him myself.\"\n\nXavier took a deep breath, opened the door and saw the chaos inside. He said, \"Melon, A.\"\n\nAbout ten minutes later, apart from Lorenzo and Xavier, everyone else left.\n\nLorenzo sat on the sofa. He stared at the chandelier on the ceiling, lost in thoughts.\n\nXavier sat next to him, \"We are not a part of your drama with Sydney. If anything, go home and solve it with her. Don't go crazy here.\"\n\nLorenzo closed his eyes. \"I\u2019m not going home.\"\n\n\"You must,\" \"Then tell me what happened between you two, I\u2019ll find a way for you.\"\n\nLorenzo, \"You can't.\"\n\n\u201cFine,\" Xavier said, \"If you won't go home, where will you go later?\"\n\n\"Chelsea will pick me up.\"\n\nXavier was stunned for a moment. \"Are you okay? You got so anxious when your wife called me. And now you\u2019re going to see another woman?\n\n\"I met you late. I don't know what happened between you and Sydney. You left her alone for two years, acting like you really don't care. However, we are not allowed to keep her contact information. What on earth are you thinking?\"\n\nLorenzo became impatient again. \"Boy, don\u2019t meddle with adult matters.\"\n\nWhen Xavier started to curse, a creaking sound came from the door. The two of them looked towards the door.\n\n\u201cEnzo,\u201d A sweet voice came.\n\nThe woman had the body of a devil and the face of an angel as she slithered in. She was the \u2018Nation\u2019s Goddess\u2019 and top tier actress, Chelsea Dune.\n \nLorenzo's expression finally softened a little when she appeared. \"Here she comes.\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows subtly.\n\nChelsea elegantly sat next to Lorenzo while avoiding the mess on the ground. She saw the cut at the corner of his eye.\n\nThe woman frowned. \"Why are you hurt?\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"It's nothing. I just drank too much.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt?\" As she spoke, Chelsea reached out and took Lorenzo's arm.\n\nXavier said with a smile, \"Hey Superstar, do you know he is married?\"\n\nChelsea paused and retracted her hand in embarrassment. \"Enzo and I are just friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, cool.\"\n\nLorenzo seemed displeased with Xavier's sarcasm towards Chelsea. He retorted, \"What are you trying to say?\"\n\nXavier stuck his tongue in his cheek and stood up with a grin. \"Nothing. Things among you guys are too complicated for my little brain. I\u2019m gonna go home to bed.\"\n\nAs soon as Xavier reached the door, the door was opened from the outside.\n\nXavier paused.\n\nSydney stood timidly at the door.\n\nShe was timid but she was objectively eye-catching.\n\nHer long, dark and wavy hair draped casually down her back. She had light makeup on her delicate and pretty face. Her lips were as bright as cherry, with a hint of sparkle.\n\nThe velvet, burgundy strappy dress contrasted with her flawless, snow-white skin. She was like a blooming red rose in the dark night.\n\nXavier gulped. He forgot how to speak at that moment.\n\nLorenzo's voice was suddenly heard. \"Who\u2019s there?\"\n\nXavier was stunned,and stepped aside to make way for Sydney. After Sydney entered the room, he exhaled and came back to his senses.\n\nAs soon as Sydney reached the door, she froze.\n\nEveryone had left. The private room had the brightest lights turned on. Right in the middle, Lorenzo and Chelsea were sitting together with their arms touching each other. To Sydney, that scene hurt her eyes more than the light.\n\nHer breath was stuck in her throat. Her lips quivered, but she could not say a word.\n\nLorenzo had an affair with Chelsea, her college bully!\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Lorenzo frowned, \"Go back!\"\n\nSydney shuddered then finally took a step. She quickened her pace.\n\nShe went up to the two of them. While everyone was caught off guard, she slapped Chelsea across the face and grabbed her hair. \"It's you!\"\n\nChelsea screamed, \"Ah! Enzo, help me!\"\n\n\u201cSydney!\u201d\n\nWhen Lorenzo spoke, Sydney let go of Chelsea. She raised her hand towards Lorenzo, but did not strike him.\n\nHer hands trembled. She broke down and shouted, \"You clearly know what she did to me back then! Of all the people, why her?!\"\n\nSuddenly.\n\nSlap!\n\nChelsea took advantage when Sydney was unguarded and slapped her back. That slap was even harder than Sydney\u2019s.\n\nSydney felt ringing in her ears, and then blood dripped from the corners of her lips.\n\nChelsea snarled, \"Why blame others if you can't keep your man?!\"\n\nSydney held her face. Her eyes turned red at Chelsea\u2019s smug expression. She shouted, \"I'm taking your life. \n\nShe tried to attack Chelsea again, but Lorenzo stopped her. He grabbed the back of her head and threw her to the other side of the sofa.\n\n\"I told you to go back, are you deaf?\"\n\nSydney felt as if she had gone deaf. The ringing in her ears was so severe that she couldn't hear what Lorenzo said. Half of her head was throbbing.\n\nAt this moment, Chelsea suddenly covered her ears and wailed, \"Enzo, I can't hear!\"\n\nLorenzo was shocked, \"You can\u2019t hear?\"\n\nChelsea's eyes widened in pity, and her cries became louder. \"I can't hear what you said...\"\n\nLorenzo looked back and glared at Sydney fiercely. He stood up, arms over Chelsea and walked out, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier, saw Lorenzo escorting a tearful Chelsea out of the room. He knew something was amiss and quickly entered the room.\n\nSydney closed her eyes and clasped her head with her hands. She fell sideways on the sofa. Her shoulders shook.\n\nAt the moment, half of that bright and charming face was as pale as paper, and the other half was marked with an angry palm print. The blood on the corners of her lips stood out even more.\n\nXavier's eyes widened and he rushed over. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney did not respond.\n\nXavier nudged her gently. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney then opened her eyes, her voice fading away, \"My, my ears hurt...\"\n\nWith the slap mark and her ear hurting, Xavier immediately understood what had happened. He helped Sydney up and said, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\nSydney only managed to take two steps before her legs gave way. She was about to crash.\n\nPeople lose strength when they cannot bear the pain. Sydney would rather die than have Lorenzo cheated on her with Chelsea.\n\nXavier felt a pang of distress. He carried Sydney in his arms and hurried out.\n\n\u2026\n\nLorenzo and Chelsea stopped outside the main entrance of Melon. He said, \"Wait for me here, I'll get the car.\"\n\nChelsea held him and said, \"Enzo, I'm better now. I don\u2019t think I need to go to the hospital. Come with me and stay with me, okay?\"\n\nLorenzo frowned, and just as he was about to agree, something behind Chelsea attracted his attention.\n\nXavier carried Sydney and walked quickly towards the parking lot.\n\nLorenzo frowned, \"Since you don't need to go to the hospital, you should go back to the hotel first.\"\n\nWith that, he turned to chase after Xavier, but Chelsea pulled him back. \"Are you going to look for Sydney? How could she treat you like that but you still can't let her go?\"\n\nChapter 0004\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He did not answer and strode after Xavier.\n\nChelsea exhaled forcefully. Her shoulders trembled. She looked at Sydney and Xavier with clear hatred and jealousy.\n\nHowever, Lorenzo did not manage to intercept Xavier. When he passed by, Xavier's car drifted gorgeously before merging onto the main freeway.\n\n\u2026\n\nInside the car.\n\nSydney crumpled into a ball and leaned against the car window. Xavier fastened the seat belt for her.\n\nTears streamed down her face the whole time, but she was expressionless, like a soulless sculpture.\n\nThe pain in her ear strained the nerves across her head, and pulled out many memories that she did not want to recall.\n\nA group of heavily made-up girls surrounded her. The proudest one leading the pack, was Chelsea, the one with the harmless face.\n\nHer smile was pure evil. She pulled Sydney\u2019s hair, and let her companions take turns to slap her. Chelsea dripped melted white ice cream on Sydney\u2019s face and chest.\n\nSydney dared not resist because her grandmother, Mary Collins, was in the hands of Christopher, Chelsea's father.\n\nThe Dunes were quite wealthy. Christopher owned a ceramics company, and Mary used to work as a cleaner in Christopher\u2019s office building.\n\nMary had always done a good job, but that day Chelsea insisted that Mary accidentally destroyed her father's documents. Even a fool knew that it was all a farce.\n\nSydney was a freshman that year and Chelsea was a sophomore.\n\nAt the Quill City Fine Arts Academy, Chelsea had always been the most sought-after goddess by many in the school. After Sydney entered the school, she stole Chelsea\u2019s glory.\n\nJealousy was written all over Chelsea's innocent face.\n\nChelsea took those humiliating photos and made Sydney look cheap. Soon, other people's harsh words tormented her as well.\n\nSydney, you are so pretty. If You planned turns a resentful woman,would your grandma still need to be a cleaner in her old age to support the family?\n\n\"Sydney! Hey, Sydney!\"\n\nXavier's words pulled her back from her thoughts.\n\nShe turned her head blankly to be met with a pair of gentle, concerned eyes.\n\nXavier saw her motionless and thought she had died with her eyes wide open.\n\nThe speed of the car was fast, and the pressure on her back felt comfortable. Sydney took the pills earlier and felt better because her discomfort was suppressed. Her ears still hurt but she could hear clearly.\n\n\"Xavier, thank you.\"\n\nXavier breathed out, \"As long as you're fine.\"\n\nSydney continued to be silent.\n\nIt was already four o'clock in the middle of the night. There were very few cars on the road.\n\nAfter Xavier turned a corner, he looked back at her.\n\nHis Adam's apple rolled quietly once more.\n\nSydney looked bright and charming from the front, but she looked even more striking with her smooth facial outline and high nose from the side. Her thick eyelashes were naturally curled; It felt like she was God\u2019s favorite.\n\nSydney stood out even among beauties and was considered stunning. She was spotted by a talent scout when she hit puberty in her first year of high school.\n\nHowever, her mother refused to allow her to enter the entertainment industry, so she had been keeping her head down at school. Initially, her mother had strict requirements. Sydney was not allowed to have long hair or wear nice clothes.\n\nThroughout high school, she had ugly short hair and wore puffy, outdated and tacky clothes. She was bullied when she started dressing up in college. It was not until she fell in love with that Black Sheep Enzo that she began to step out of her shell because she had someone to protect her.\n\nXavier broke the silence in the car again. \"You knew that all the boys have only known Lorenzo in the past three or four years. Am I right to say that you and Lorenzo have known each other for a long time?\"\n\nWith that, Sydney said, \"Yeah, he was my first love. I dated him when I was a freshman. He stayed with me throughout my college days for four years. We broke up when I graduated...\"\n\n\"After two years of separation, the elders in our respective families crossed paths by accident, and they arranged for us to get married for some reason. I was willing to get married, but he was not.\"\n\nXavier frowned. \"Do you...love him very much?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Sydney\u2019s voice trembled again, \"He used to be... very good to me. Extremely good.\"\n\nShe was deeply caught up by their love, whereby a simple sentence could dig up those heavy and profound memories.\n\n\"I don't have a father. Lorenzo not only gave me the sense of security that a boyfriend should, but he was protective like a father.\n\n\"For every holiday, others are picked up by their parents, but Lorenzo picked me up. At every start of the school season, parents would send their kids to class, but Lorenzo would send me. The day before school started, he would help me check my luggage. He would make sure I had everything I needed. He would also secretly put money into the pockets of my clothes.\u201d\n\nSydney's tears rolled down her cheeks again as she recalled those memories.\n\nXavier tightened his grip on the steering wheel. His expression became heavy. He did not expect Lorenzo to have such a tender and considerate side.\n\nHowever, tenderness and consideration were the most fearful things in a relationship because trying to move on after a breakup was tantamount to chipping away at the bones.\n\nAfter a moment, Xavier spoke, \"You are now... relying on his past kindness to you to support your marriage.\"\n\nThis sentence summed up her lonely married life for the past two years. Sydney lifted her hand and wiped her eyes, \"I am not willing to lose him. We were so good together; I really can't accept the current situation...\"\n   \n\nXavier said, \"But Sydney, have you ever thought about it? Many couples who have been estranged were once deeply in love in the past. You\u2019ve been tormenting yourself by living in the past. You will definitely meet a man who treats you better in the future.\"\n\nSydney sobbed, \"I tried moving on, but I still can't get over...\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows and changed his approach. \"Chelsea hit you, but he took Chelsea away without concern for you. Can you bear it?\"\n\nSydney was stunned for a moment. The hidden deep affection in her eyes was immediately replaced by hatred as her emotions flared up.\n\n\"No, I told Lorenzo from the start that anyone who is friends with Chelsea is my enemy. Did Lorenzo really have feelings for Chelsea, or did he do it deliberately to spite me...\n\n\"No, I can't think like that either,\" she began to mumble through her chaotic thoughts, \"No matter what his purpose is, if he really slept with Chelsea...\"\n\nShe did not continue, but closed her eyes and began to take deep breaths.\n\nSome scenes were just fantasies, but enough to suffocate her.\n\nXavier's heart ached a little when he saw Sydney in pain. At the same time, he was also curious about what happened between Sydney and Chelsea.\n\nJust as he was about to ask, his cell phone, which he had thrown inside the armrest storage, rang.\n\nHe looked down. It was a call from Lorenzo.\n\nXavier frowned, turned over his phone and clicked to hang up. He glanced in the rearview mirror again.\n\nBehind him was a flashy, black and red car, the world\u2019s rarest supercar. A toy owned by the richest man in Quill City.\n\nXavier looked at Sydney again. Her sobs could really melt a man's heart. He secretly gripped the steering wheel.\n\nIt was not Sydney who gave him her number first. The men, including him, noticed Lorenzo's indifference towards her, but were too captivated by her beauty, so they asked for it behind Lorenzo's back.\n\nOf course, they all found a perfect reason. They asked Sydney to leave her number, so they could contact her for business purposes.\n\nAt that time, no one dared to have filthy intentions. She was Lorenzo's legal wife, and Lorenzo was one of the most outstanding people among his friends.\n\nAside from the fact that Sydney was married, she was indeed a rare beauty. Everyone thought it was harmless to keep a beautiful woman\u2019s phone number.\n\nHowever, things were different now.\n\nHe swerved the steering wheel abruptly and turned around in the opposite direction. He accelerated to 200 miles an hour, and threw Lorenzo off his trail.\n\nChapter 0005\nXavier was driving dangerously fast, but his expression was exceptionally calm.\n\nIn addition to running several companies, he was also a part-time F2 racing driver.\n\nFor Lorenzo, the supercar was just a means of transportation, but in Xavier's hands, it was a toy. He was sure that Lorenzo would not be able to catch up.\n\nLorenzo watched Xavier's car zoom by his car like a ghost. He was stunned for a moment and quickly turned around. Two minutes later, he lost them.\n\nHe continued to call Xavier while flooring the accelerator, but still no one answered.\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier knew that he had other intentions when he ditched Lorenzo, but he dared not show it in front of Sydney right away.\n\nAfter all, she was still Lorenzo's wife. Xavier was one year younger than Lorenzo whom he regarded as his blood brother, so she was his sister-in-law, in a sense.\n\nHe took her to the hospital as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter the medical check-up to make sure there were no major problems, Xavier took Sydney back to Celestial Park after applying ice patches to her face.\n\nCelestial Park was a famous luxury residential area in Quill City. Sydney and Lorenzo bought their marital home here.\n\nAs soon as Sydney got to the bedroom, she saw Lorenzo sitting on the sofa at the end of the bed. There was a bottle of white wine on the round table next to him.\n\nSydney's eyes flashed. Without saying a word, she went to bed, lay down, and closed her eyes.\n\nA few seconds later, the man's footsteps were heard.\n\nSydney shivered. Her eyelashes became wet again.\n\nLorenzo suddenly got on the bed and pressed on her. She opened her eyes and started to push him away. \"Don't touch me...\"\n\nLorenzo paused, grabbed her collar with both hands, and tore her skirt apart.\n\nSydney's eyes widened with shock. Her screams echoed through the bedroom. \"Don't touch me with the hand you used to touch Chelsea Dune!\"\n\nLorenzo froze.\n\nSydney looked at him as tears poured down her face. \"I can have no dignity in front of you because we were dependent on each other for those four years. You provided a great deal for me, and you are also the closest person to me besides my mother and grandmother. My heart breaks for you because you were hurt by what happened back then. I can\u2019t bear to see you in deep pain every day because of me so I allow you to vent your grievances by hurting me!\n\n\u201cBut I can't share the same man with Chelsea, and I can't have the hand that touched her, touch me!!\n\n\u201cShe is the last straw of my dignity, Lorenzo!\"\n\nHowever, these words did not move Lorenzo to show any guilt.\n\nInstead, he became angrier. \"What about my last straw?\"\n\n\"I was disgusted by you too after Oliver touched you. What you do that night when we got registered?\"\n  \nSydney trembled. She choked.\n\nThat night.\n  \nHer mother and mother-in-law both wanted to seize the opportunity so that she and Lorenzo could have a child as soon as possible, so they tampered with their tea.\n\nLorenzo thought it was Sydney who Framed him.\n\n\"Why aren't you talking?\" Lorenzo's eyes were red as he stared into hers, \"Where did Xavier take you? He deliberately didn't answer my call. What did you do?\"\n\n\"Can you stop being suspicious of everyone and anyone? He took me to the hospital!\"\n\n\"Hospital?\" Lorenzo sneered, and he tightened his grip on her clothes, this time tearing her skirt all the way, \"Sydney, lift your legs for me!\"\n\nSydney panicked. \"What are you going to do?!\"\n\n\"Let's see if you betrayed me again!\"\n\nSydney immediately closed her knees together, \"I didn't!\"\n\nLorenzo pressed harder and his voice became more forceful, \"I don't believe a word you said!\"\n\nSuch stubborn words made Sydney lose the will to refute him.\n\nShe looked at Lorenzo\u2019s frightening and gloomy face and felt disgusted with him for the first time.\n\nShe reached out and pinched the back of his hand. \"Let me go, I'm tired, I want to sleep!\"\n\n\"I don't want to sleep, why should you sleep!\" Lorenzo was still furious. He did not seem to feel any pain in the back of his hand. The grip in his hand became stronger and stronger.\n\nHe pulled apart Sydney's knees quickly. He spread her legs apart so hard that even her behinds hurt.\n\nHe was worried that she would resist, so he pressed his knee on her belly and untied his belt.\n\nSydney's tears rolled to the side of her temples and wet the pillow. Still, she said nothing. Since pinching the back of his hand did not work, she pinched his neck hard.\n\nLorenzo winced in pain, but still did not let her go.\n\nIt felt as if he would not give up if he did not test her.\n\nLorenzo's neck,and even his arms and abdominal muscles were left bruised from Sydney's pinching while she gradually lost hope.\n\nShe wilted like dry roses, losing all trace of vitality.\n\nLorenzo endured the pain and tried to control her, but failed.\n\nSydney's tearful eyes trembled. Her hand squeezing his chest loosened, and she finally spoke again, \"Is that enough?\"\n\n\"Enough?\" Unexpectedly, Lorenzo felt even more enraged. He reached out and yanked open the drawer on the bedside table, took out the bottle of essential oil she bought, and then slammed the drawer shut!\n\nSydney seized this opportunity and tried to escape, but he grabbed her ankle in time. \"Be good!\"\n\nSydney stopped resisting. She knew she would not be able to escape tonight.\n\nShe was in tears, but she laughed. \"Lorenzo, I really didn't expect that one day I would be disgusted with you. Go ahead, disgust me more. So I can hate you enough, and give you what you want...\"\n\nShe thought, \u2018Lorenzo should know what I was referring to.\u2019\n\nIn the split second, her refusal to sign the divorce agreement suddenly wavered.\n\nDuring the time between being taken away by Xavier and being sent back home, she had been recalling the past.\n\nWhen she recalled the past with Chelsea, she did not want to lose her self-esteem. However, when she recalled every moment with Lorenzo, she did not want to regret losing the man she loved most.\n\nShe was deeply confused by these opposing feelings.\n\nHowever, right now, she actually felt disgusted with the man she loved most.\n\nShe was glad.\n\nDisgusted by him meant that she could finally let him go one day. \n\nLorenzo's face darkened at Sydney\u2019s words. He could not tell whether he was angry or something else.\n\nShe wanted to say more, but Lorenzo's lips suddenly covered hers.\n\nAt the same time, his fingertips of both hands trailed up along her waistline.\n\nThe faint smell of tobacco mixed with the fragrance and wine was an alluring masculine aroma. In the past, she could never resist his kisses.\n\nLorenzo was even wilder in the past than he is now. He was like a lion in the savanna. The passion and impulse he made her feel was strong and without restraint.\n\nApart from the four years they were separated, they had slept together for four years until now. He understood every part of her body, her preferred tension and pressure.\n\nSoon, her body reacted uncontrollably."

                      "text": "Chapter 0001\nIt was ten o'clock in the evening. Sydney Castro sat in front of the dressing table, rubbing essential oils on her body for that glowing skin.\n\nClearly, she was getting ready to please a man.\n\nHer husband, whom she had not seen for two years, was returning to Somerland today. She missed him terribly.\n\nSydney oiled every part of her body until she was soft and smooth. Then she put on a white, furry lingerie set with a cheeky little cat tail on the small of her back.\n\nIn truth, she did not have to go to such trouble in the past. Lorenzo had wished he could stick to her every day, but after that fateful day, everything changed.\n\nShe went from being his closest lover to the woman he hated the most.\n\nLater, their elders arranged for them to get married. However, Lorenzo was so reluctant that he left the country the day after signing their marriage certificate.\n\nNow two years have passed, during which he only contacted her once. It was six months after her mother's death that he sent her a divorce agreement.\n\nSydney did not sign the papers. She still harbored thoughts of rekindling her marriage with Lorenzo.\n\nHowever, it was difficult.\n\nShe was not even aware he was returning tonight. She only found out when she saw Lorenzo\u2019s friends posted about their drinking session on social media.\n\nLater, she called her mother-in-law, who helped her and sent a driver to bring Lorenzo back.\n\nThe driver called. Lorenzo would be home in a few minutes.\n\nShe had to seize this opportunity and try to rekindle their old flame again.\n\nIntentionally dressed up, she knelt on fours by the bed, evenly distributing the rose petals that had been sprinkled on the bed in advance. She was so engrossed that she did not notice a long shadow walking in.\n\nSuddenly, Sydney\u2019s cat tail was yanked hard as a hot-blooded torso pressed on her back. Her heart skipped a beat. She turned back and came face-to-face with a deep yet intense set of piercing eyes.\n\n\"Enzo...\" she began delicately, \"You finally came...\" Back.\n\nThe rest of her sentence was choked back by a kiss reeking of ethanol.\n\nSydney's eyelashes fluttered as her body responded to his. She was not sure whether Lorenzo was drunk or if her outfit tonight was a success. \n\nLorenzo kissed her so passionately that he wanted to suck her lips swollen. He placed his hands over her waist , grabbing them vigorously.\n\nThe man seemed satisfied. While taking a breath, he growled in a whisper. \"good...\"\n\nGrowling in a whisper was considered flirting. That was Lorenzo\u2019s special habit. \n\nRecently, she had been doing yoga. Her figure was way better than two years ago. This was also a surprise for Lorenzo. His words and actions ignited the fire in her heart.\n\nHer plump waist rose and fell violently. Her rapid breath escaped her rosy lips. Her glowy, fair hands explored his waist through his custom silk shirt, caressing his hard and steamy muscles for the first time in a long time. She hurriedly unbuttoned his shirt.\n\nThe smooth material slid down his strong arms. She unbuckled his belt and wrapped her legs around his waist.\n\nEight years of familiarity with each other made them very compatible in bed. No need for any fluff, they went straight into it.\n\nPerhaps it was because they had not seen each other for too long. His desire seemed to be even more intense than hers, just like when he first tasted the forbidden fruit eight years ago. The man was excited and tireless.\n\nThis went on for more than three hours. Finally, he was satisfied.\n\nSydney laid on the man's beautiful sculpted chest and kissed his handsome face obsessively, trying to make up for lost time.\n\nLorenzo kept his eyes closed, allowing her kisses.\n\n \"I'm very pleased with you tonight.\"Lorenzo said\n\nSydney smiled and kissed the corner of his lips again.\n\nLorenzo raised the corners of his lips. He grabbed her waist hard, and turned over to hold her down.\n\nSydney was sure that he was in a good mood now.\n\nShe stretched out her hand to rub his Adam's apple. Right before they did it again, she said bluntly, \"Enzo, four years ago\u2026I swear nothing happened between Oliver and I. My body and soul completely belong to you. You are finally back. Can we please forget what happened that day and move forward together?\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the smile on the man's face froze instantly.\n\nLorenzo raised his hand and grabbed Sydney\u2019s throat. \n\nSydney's heart skipped a beat. She widened her eyes in panic. It was over. She had said the wrong thing.\n\nThis happened twice before. If she mentioned the words \"four years ago\", Lorenzo would immediately become ruthless and sinister.\n\nHer best friend once said that Lorenzo's reaction was akin to PTSD, a post-traumatic stress reaction.\n\nShe had doubts at the time, and it turned out to be the same today, which proved that her best friend was right.\n\nIn a daze, she heard Lorenzo say, \"Move forward with me? You?\n\n\"I touched you tonight because I'm afraid that you,  wouldn\u2019t change your disgusting habit and sleep with my friends again!\"\n\n\"I won't, I didn\u2019t...\" Sydney explained and reached out to touch his hand, attempting to soothe him.\n\nLorenzo's hand tightened, \"Don't touch me!\"\n\nSydney's face was red from Lorenzo\u2019s grip on her throat.\n\nLorenzo took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. \"You'd better sign the divorce agreement as soon as possible. The past love we had will never be rekindled.\"\n\n The words \u2018divorce agreement\u2019 stabbed Sydney\u2019s heart like a sword. She looked up anxiously, and said with difficulty, \"We were so good back then. Are you going to completely deny all that I\u2019ve done for you, just because of that incident?\n\n\"Oliver and I both explained back then that nothing happened to us. We were set up!\"\n\nHowever, the more she explained, the angrier Lorenzo became. His hand went up her neck and grabbed her chin. The force in his grip became stronger and stronger. Sydney could feel that he wanted to crush her chin.\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\nHe ignored her cries of pain.\n\n\"Set up? Lying on the same bed with him might be a set up, but what about the child in your belly?\"\n\n\"Sydney, I wanted so badly for that baby to be mine at that time... But all the hospitals we went to in Quill City showed the same result: You were fifteen days conceived a baby.!\n\n\"I was on a business trip for two months and you were fifteen days conceived a baby. How could you make me believe that nothing happened between you and him?!\"\n\nAfter that, Lorenzo shook her off.\n\nSydney fell on the pillow. She straightened her messy hair, stood up again and explained shakily, \"But the first doctor I consulted was a traditional medicine practitioner. The old doctor said that I was two months conceived a baby. I didn't tell you immediately because I wanted to wait for you to come back to give you a surprise!\n\n\"You\u2019ve met that old doctor too. He showed you the prescription he gave me with the time written on it. Why won't you...\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Lorenzo interrupted her, \"Handwritten time has no credibility, and it's easier to bribe an old traditional medicine practitioner. Stop now and shut up!\"\n\nShe stood in his shoes and could understand the hurt in his heart. However, she still felt heartbroken from how he decisively shunned her.\n\nEspecially their child. The rejection was heartbreakingly painful.\n\nShe knew it was useless to say anything, so she kept quiet and shed tears of frustration.\n\nLorenzo got out of bed and made a phone call.\n\nThe room was quiet. As the call connected, Sydney heard the voice on the other end. She quickly got out of bed.\n\nA woman\u2019s voice. \"Mr. Bailey\u2026\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"Are you still here?\"\n\nWoman, \"Yes, do you want to come over?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lorenzo said and hung up the phone. \n\nSydney held him back. Her eyes widened with tears and her voice trembled. \"Are you seeing someone else?\"\n\nChapter 0002\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\nSydney\u2019s world collapsed as she burst into tears. \"When did it happen?! Who is she?!\"\n\nShe looked utterly miserable now. Lorenzo had no mercy, he might have even felt a little pleasure seeing her in pain.\n\n\"Can\u2019t stand seeing me with someone else?\"\n\nYes, she could not stand it.\n\nLoving a person would inherently make one possessive. Lorenzo meant so much to her that she could not accept losing him.\n\nAt this moment, the way she was just speechlessly hyperventilating due to the blow was more pathetic than crying. It felt like she was falling to pieces.\n\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He got dressed and left the bedroom.\n\nSydney refused to give up and chased after him. \"Why won\u2019t you believe that I was set up?\"\n\nLorenzo stopped and turned around. \"Then tell me, who set you up?\"\n\nThe corridor of the mansion was wide and long. Sydney was speechless as she looked at the lanky man in white shirt and trousers.    \n\nFour years ago, they talked about this many times. Each time they got stuck here.\n\nExactly.\n\nShe still did not find out who did it.\n\nThe setup was extremely vicious.\n\nLorenzo and Sydney\u2019s relationship turned from true love to pure hatred. They were so miserable for each other that it broke apart Lorenzo and Oliver\u2019s friendship. It also caused Sydney to become mentally ill, miscarrying from extreme heartache...\n\nHowever, she still could not identify the mastermind behind this! Four years ago, Sydney and Oliver searched for a long time but to no avail.\n\nLorenzo left.\n\nSydney stood in the corridor for a long time. She clutched her chest and raced towards the room at the corner of the corridor, calling out with each step, \"Mrs. Harper...\"\n\nHer breath became shorter each time.\n\nWhen she reached the door, she reached out and knocked, then her vision went dark as she fell to the ground unconscious.\n\nThe door opened shortly. The nanny had the shock of her life and quickly picked Sydney up in panic. \"Madam!\"\n\nThe sound of a car driving away was heard downstairs.\n\nSydney regained consciousness after Mrs. Harper gave her first aid.\n\nMrs. Harper had a glass of water and a handful of white pills in her hand. She said, \"Madam, why don't you tell your husband about your condition? If he sympathizes with you because of this, you might...\"\n\nSydney shook her head stubbornly, \"He and I are together because we love each other. I don't want to be pitied.\"\n\nShe took the pills and swallowed them. She closed her eyes and kept silent for a long time, then she said to Mrs. Harper, \"He\u2019s seeing someone else. I want to know who she is. Tell me, is it okay for me to ask his friends?\"\n\n\u2026\n\nMelon, the largest nightclub in Quill City.\n\nMusic was blaring in a VIP room. Lorenzo kicked the door open and went in. The men who were dancing intimately with the women almost soiled their pants.\n\nHowever, no one dared to be angry.\n\nLorenzo was a peculiar legend in Quill City. In his youth, he was an uncivilized and rebellious devil. Despite being a member of the Bailey Group, the wealthiest corporation in Quill City, he was cast out as the black sheep of the family and was dead broke.\n\nLater, his parents could not stand it anymore and made a plan for him to study abroad. He refused without hesitation. Instead, he relied on the prize money he got from a gaming tournament and simply enrolled himself in a vocational school.\n\nSuch a self-destructive person suddenly changed at the age of twenty.\n\nLorenzo became extremely hard-working. He diligently went to class and hung out in the library. He would also dress up and leave the dormitory at around six o'clock every morning. He rode the bicycle for an hour to Quill City Fine Arts Academy for lectures.\n\nSome people claimed that he had fallen in love with a student from Quill City Fine Arts Academy.\n\nNot long after, he wanted to start a company. His family was not supportive, of course. So, he put a knife to Grandpa Bailey\u2019s throat and grabbed 300 million to open a jewelry company, registered as Cherr.y.\n\nAt that time, the Baileys thought that the 300 million was burned for good. However, Cherr.y turned out to be unexpectedly successful. It made ten times the profit in its second year. In the fourth year, it was listed in Newford.\n\nToday, the \u2018Black Sheep\u2019 was a self-made man and had become the heir to the Bailey Group. Cherr.y had become a world-renowned jewelry brand.\n\nAs soon as Lorenzo sat down on the sofa, a group of beauties quickly came over and said, \"Mr. Bailey!\"\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nThe women trembled in fright and scurried away. Two more men sat down and said, \"Lorenzo, what pissed you off at home?\"\n\nLorenzo kept quiet. He picked up a glass and started chugging.\n\nThe others did not say anything anymore. They picked up their glass to drink with him.\n\nNot a moment later, someone's cell phone rang on the table.\n\n\"Xavier, your phone!\"\n\nA handsome man with platinum blond hair sat up on the sofa in a dark hidden corner.\n\nXavier woke up from his nap and scratched his tattooed neck. He took a look at his cell phone and his eyes widened.\n\n\"Lorenzo,\" he looked at Lorenzo, \"Why is Sydney calling me?\"\n\nLorenzo paused mid-drink and looked at Xavier. \"Who?\"\n\nXavier walked up to him with his cell phone, \"Your wife!\"\n\nLorenzo's expression turned sinister. \"When did you get her number?\"\n\nXavier said casually, \"On the day you both got married, I gave her my number when we sang together in the karaoke bar.\"\n\nHearing that, Lorenzo stood up abruptly and grabbed Xavier's collar, \"Who asked you to give your number?\"\n\nXavier frowned, puzzled at his friend\u2019s sudden rage. He pushed Lorenzo's hand away, \"We were all having fun, what\u2019s the big deal in exchanging contact information?\"\n\nLorenzo got angry. \"WHY\"\n\nWith that, he punched the undefended Xavier.\n\nXavier was caught off guard and slammed onto the marble table. The wine and glasses on the table clattered onto the floor.\n\nThe atmosphere froze. Lorenzo's eyes turned red like a furious beast. He growled, \"Delete her number!\"\n\nXavier was no sitting duck either. He was the second generation of the Altmans, an old money family in Quill City.  He was the prodigal son of the Altmans, a notorious troublemaker. He could hang out frequently with Lorenzo because they were similar.\n\nXavier wiped the bleeding corner of his lips and punched Lorenzo in return. \"What's going on, Popeye? Use your words, not your fists!\"\n\nLorenzo was hit on the head. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then he grabbed Xavier, pressed him on the sofa and beat him in a frenzy. \"How many times have you contacted Sydney in the past two years?!!\"\n\nXavier dodged Lorenzo's heavy punches and said, \"Why would I contact your wife like I have nothing else to do?! Have you gone mad? I'll admit you to the mental hospital!\"\n\nThese words seemed to hit a nerve. Lorenzo paused. \n\nHe was stunned for a few seconds. Then, he sat down on the side and then closed his eyes to quell the anger in his heart.\n\nXavier sat up, frowned and rubbed his shoulders. Vulgarities spewed.\n\nLorenzo ignored Xavier. After a while, he calmed down. He opened his eagle eyes and scanned the other men in the room, \"Who else saved her number?\"\n\nImmediately, several men lowered their heads to look for their phones.\n\nLorenzo was startled.\n\nImmediately, terrifying sounds of broken bottles filled the space, as well as Lorenzo's angry swear words, and screams of women as they dodge shards of glass.\n\nLorenzo seemed to have lost his mind and started attacking all his friends.\n\nXavier stepped outside with his cell phone and returned Sydney\u2019s call.\n\nWhen Sydney picked up, Xavier humbly said, \"Hi, Sydney. What's the matter?\"\n\nSydney's voice was gentle and polite. \"Xavier, I'm sorry to bother you. Lorenzo got a little upset with me tonight. He blocked me and I can't contact him. I wanted to ask if you know where he is.\"\n\nChapter 0003\n\"He was drinking with me, and now he's drunk and acting crazy. I'll send him back to you later. Don\u2019t worry.\"\n\nSydney paused for a moment then said, \"Can you give me the address? I want to check on him myself.\"\n\nXavier took a deep breath, opened the door and saw the chaos inside. He said, \"Melon, A.\"\n\nAbout ten minutes later, apart from Lorenzo and Xavier, everyone else left.\n\nLorenzo sat on the sofa. He stared at the chandelier on the ceiling, lost in thoughts.\n\nXavier sat next to him, \"We are not a part of your drama with Sydney. If anything, go home and solve it with her. Don't go crazy here.\"\n\nLorenzo closed his eyes. \"I\u2019m not going home.\"\n\n\"You must,\" \"Then tell me what happened between you two, I\u2019ll find a way for you.\"\n\nLorenzo, \"You can't.\"\n\n\u201cFine,\" Xavier said, \"If you won't go home, where will you go later?\"\n\n\"Chelsea will pick me up.\"\n\nXavier was stunned for a moment. \"Are you okay? You got so anxious when your wife called me. And now you\u2019re going to see another woman?\n\n\"I met you late. I don't know what happened between you and Sydney. You left her alone for two years, acting like you really don't care. However, we are not allowed to keep her contact information. What on earth are you thinking?\"\n\nLorenzo became impatient again. \"Boy, don\u2019t meddle with adult matters.\"\n\nWhen Xavier started to curse, a creaking sound came from the door. The two of them looked towards the door.\n\n\u201cEnzo,\u201d A sweet voice came.\n\nThe woman had the body of a devil and the face of an angel as she slithered in. She was the \u2018Nation\u2019s Goddess\u2019 and top tier actress, Chelsea Dune.\n \nLorenzo's expression finally softened a little when she appeared. \"Here she comes.\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows subtly.\n\nChelsea elegantly sat next to Lorenzo while avoiding the mess on the ground. She saw the cut at the corner of his eye.\n\nThe woman frowned. \"Why are you hurt?\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"It's nothing. I just drank too much.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt?\" As she spoke, Chelsea reached out and took Lorenzo's arm.\n\nXavier said with a smile, \"Hey Superstar, do you know he is married?\"\n\nChelsea paused and retracted her hand in embarrassment. \"Enzo and I are just friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, cool.\"\n\nLorenzo seemed displeased with Xavier's sarcasm towards Chelsea. He retorted, \"What are you trying to say?\"\n\nXavier stuck his tongue in his cheek and stood up with a grin. \"Nothing. Things among you guys are too complicated for my little brain. I\u2019m gonna go home to bed.\"\n\nAs soon as Xavier reached the door, the door was opened from the outside.\n\nXavier paused.\n\nSydney stood timidly at the door.\n\nShe was timid but she was objectively eye-catching.\n\nHer long, dark and wavy hair draped casually down her back. She had light makeup on her delicate and pretty face. Her lips were as bright as cherry, with a hint of sparkle.\n\nThe velvet, burgundy strappy dress contrasted with her flawless, snow-white skin. She was like a blooming red rose in the dark night.\n\nXavier gulped. He forgot how to speak at that moment.\n\nLorenzo's voice was suddenly heard. \"Who\u2019s there?\"\n\nXavier was stunned,and stepped aside to make way for Sydney. After Sydney entered the room, he exhaled and came back to his senses.\n\nAs soon as Sydney reached the door, she froze.\n\nEveryone had left. The private room had the brightest lights turned on. Right in the middle, Lorenzo and Chelsea were sitting together with their arms touching each other. To Sydney, that scene hurt her eyes more than the light.\n\nHer breath was stuck in her throat. Her lips quivered, but she could not say a word.\n\nLorenzo had an affair with Chelsea, her college bully!\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Lorenzo frowned, \"Go back!\"\n\nSydney shuddered then finally took a step. She quickened her pace.\n\nShe went up to the two of them. While everyone was caught off guard, she slapped Chelsea across the face and grabbed her hair. \"It's you!\"\n\nChelsea screamed, \"Ah! Enzo, help me!\"\n\n\u201cSydney!\u201d\n\nWhen Lorenzo spoke, Sydney let go of Chelsea. She raised her hand towards Lorenzo, but did not strike him.\n\nHer hands trembled. She broke down and shouted, \"You clearly know what she did to me back then! Of all the people, why her?!\"\n\nSuddenly.\n\nSlap!\n\nChelsea took advantage when Sydney was unguarded and slapped her back. That slap was even harder than Sydney\u2019s.\n\nSydney felt ringing in her ears, and then blood dripped from the corners of her lips.\n\nChelsea snarled, \"Why blame others if you can't keep your man?!\"\n\nSydney held her face. Her eyes turned red at Chelsea\u2019s smug expression. She shouted, \"I'm taking your life. \n\nShe tried to attack Chelsea again, but Lorenzo stopped her. He grabbed the back of her head and threw her to the other side of the sofa.\n\n\"I told you to go back, are you deaf?\"\n\nSydney felt as if she had gone deaf. The ringing in her ears was so severe that she couldn't hear what Lorenzo said. Half of her head was throbbing.\n\nAt this moment, Chelsea suddenly covered her ears and wailed, \"Enzo, I can't hear!\"\n\nLorenzo was shocked, \"You can\u2019t hear?\"\n\nChelsea's eyes widened in pity, and her cries became louder. \"I can't hear what you said...\"\n\nLorenzo looked back and glared at Sydney fiercely. He stood up, arms over Chelsea and walked out, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier, saw Lorenzo escorting a tearful Chelsea out of the room. He knew something was amiss and quickly entered the room.\n\nSydney closed her eyes and clasped her head with her hands. She fell sideways on the sofa. Her shoulders shook.\n\nAt the moment, half of that bright and charming face was as pale as paper, and the other half was marked with an angry palm print. The blood on the corners of her lips stood out even more.\n\nXavier's eyes widened and he rushed over. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney did not respond.\n\nXavier nudged her gently. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney then opened her eyes, her voice fading away, \"My, my ears hurt...\"\n\nWith the slap mark and her ear hurting, Xavier immediately understood what had happened. He helped Sydney up and said, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\nSydney only managed to take two steps before her legs gave way. She was about to crash.\n\nPeople lose strength when they cannot bear the pain. Sydney would rather die than have Lorenzo cheated on her with Chelsea.\n\nXavier felt a pang of distress. He carried Sydney in his arms and hurried out.\n\n\u2026\n\nLorenzo and Chelsea stopped outside the main entrance of Melon. He said, \"Wait for me here, I'll get the car.\"\n\nChelsea held him and said, \"Enzo, I'm better now. I don\u2019t think I need to go to the hospital. Come with me and stay with me, okay?\"\n\nLorenzo frowned, and just as he was about to agree, something behind Chelsea attracted his attention.\n\nXavier carried Sydney and walked quickly towards the parking lot.\n\nLorenzo frowned, \"Since you don't need to go to the hospital, you should go back to the hotel first.\"\n\nWith that, he turned to chase after Xavier, but Chelsea pulled him back. \"Are you going to look for Sydney? How could she treat you like that but you still can't let her go?\"\n\nChapter 0004\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He did not answer and strode after Xavier.\n\nChelsea exhaled forcefully. Her shoulders trembled. She looked at Sydney and Xavier with clear hatred and jealousy.\n\nHowever, Lorenzo did not manage to intercept Xavier. When he passed by, Xavier's car drifted gorgeously before merging onto the main freeway.\n\n\u2026\n\nInside the car.\n\nSydney crumpled into a ball and leaned against the car window. Xavier fastened the seat belt for her.\n\nTears streamed down her face the whole time, but she was expressionless, like a soulless sculpture.\n\nThe pain in her ear strained the nerves across her head, and pulled out many memories that she did not want to recall.\n\nA group of heavily made-up girls surrounded her. The proudest one leading the pack, was Chelsea, the one with the harmless face.\n\nHer smile was pure evil. She pulled Sydney\u2019s hair, and let her companions take turns to slap her. Chelsea dripped melted white ice cream on Sydney\u2019s face and chest.\n\nSydney dared not resist because her grandmother, Mary Collins, was in the hands of Christopher, Chelsea's father.\n\nThe Dunes were quite wealthy. Christopher owned a ceramics company, and Mary used to work as a cleaner in Christopher\u2019s office building.\n\nMary had always done a good job, but that day Chelsea insisted that Mary accidentally destroyed her father's documents. Even a fool knew that it was all a farce.\n\nSydney was a freshman that year and Chelsea was a sophomore.\n\nAt the Quill City Fine Arts Academy, Chelsea had always been the most sought-after goddess by many in the school. After Sydney entered the school, she stole Chelsea\u2019s glory.\n\nJealousy was written all over Chelsea's innocent face.\n\nChelsea took those humiliating photos and made Sydney look cheap. Soon, other people's harsh words tormented her as well.\n\nSydney, you are so pretty. If You planned turns a resentful woman,would your grandma still need to be a cleaner in her old age to support the family?\n\n\"Sydney! Hey, Sydney!\"\n\nXavier's words pulled her back from her thoughts.\n\nShe turned her head blankly to be met with a pair of gentle, concerned eyes.\n\nXavier saw her motionless and thought she had died with her eyes wide open.\n\nThe speed of the car was fast, and the pressure on her back felt comfortable. Sydney took the pills earlier and felt better because her discomfort was suppressed. Her ears still hurt but she could hear clearly.\n\n\"Xavier, thank you.\"\n\nXavier breathed out, \"As long as you're fine.\"\n\nSydney continued to be silent.\n\nIt was already four o'clock in the middle of the night. There were very few cars on the road.\n\nAfter Xavier turned a corner, he looked back at her.\n\nHis Adam's apple rolled quietly once more.\n\nSydney looked bright and charming from the front, but she looked even more striking with her smooth facial outline and high nose from the side. Her thick eyelashes were naturally curled; It felt like she was God\u2019s favorite.\n\nSydney stood out even among beauties and was considered stunning. She was spotted by a talent scout when she hit puberty in her first year of high school.\n\nHowever, her mother refused to allow her to enter the entertainment industry, so she had been keeping her head down at school. Initially, her mother had strict requirements. Sydney was not allowed to have long hair or wear nice clothes.\n\nThroughout high school, she had ugly short hair and wore puffy, outdated and tacky clothes. She was bullied when she started dressing up in college. It was not until she fell in love with that Black Sheep Enzo that she began to step out of her shell because she had someone to protect her.\n\nXavier broke the silence in the car again. \"You knew that all the boys have only known Lorenzo in the past three or four years. Am I right to say that you and Lorenzo have known each other for a long time?\"\n\nWith that, Sydney said, \"Yeah, he was my first love. I dated him when I was a freshman. He stayed with me throughout my college days for four years. We broke up when I graduated...\"\n\n\"After two years of separation, the elders in our respective families crossed paths by accident, and they arranged for us to get married for some reason. I was willing to get married, but he was not.\"\n\nXavier frowned. \"Do you...love him very much?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Sydney\u2019s voice trembled again, \"He used to be... very good to me. Extremely good.\"\n\nShe was deeply caught up by their love, whereby a simple sentence could dig up those heavy and profound memories.\n\n\"I don't have a father. Lorenzo not only gave me the sense of security that a boyfriend should, but he was protective like a father.\n\n\"For every holiday, others are picked up by their parents, but Lorenzo picked me up. At every start of the school season, parents would send their kids to class, but Lorenzo would send me. The day before school started, he would help me check my luggage. He would make sure I had everything I needed. He would also secretly put money into the pockets of my clothes.\u201d\n\nSydney's tears rolled down her cheeks again as she recalled those memories.\n\nXavier tightened his grip on the steering wheel. His expression became heavy. He did not expect Lorenzo to have such a tender and considerate side.\n\nHowever, tenderness and consideration were the most fearful things in a relationship because trying to move on after a breakup was tantamount to chipping away at the bones.\n\nAfter a moment, Xavier spoke, \"You are now... relying on his past kindness to you to support your marriage.\"\n\nThis sentence summed up her lonely married life for the past two years. Sydney lifted her hand and wiped her eyes, \"I am not willing to lose him. We were so good together; I really can't accept the current situation...\"\n   \n\nXavier said, \"But Sydney, have you ever thought about it? Many couples who have been estranged were once deeply in love in the past. You\u2019ve been tormenting yourself by living in the past. You will definitely meet a man who treats you better in the future.\"\n\nSydney sobbed, \"I tried moving on, but I still can't get over...\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows and changed his approach. \"Chelsea hit you, but he took Chelsea away without concern for you. Can you bear it?\"\n\nSydney was stunned for a moment. The hidden deep affection in her eyes was immediately replaced by hatred as her emotions flared up.\n\n\"No, I told Lorenzo from the start that anyone who is friends with Chelsea is my enemy. Did Lorenzo really have feelings for Chelsea, or did he do it deliberately to spite me...\n\n\"No, I can't think like that either,\" she began to mumble through her chaotic thoughts, \"No matter what his purpose is, if he really slept with Chelsea...\"\n\nShe did not continue, but closed her eyes and began to take deep breaths.\n\nSome scenes were just fantasies, but enough to suffocate her.\n\nXavier's heart ached a little when he saw Sydney in pain. At the same time, he was also curious about what happened between Sydney and Chelsea.\n\nJust as he was about to ask, his cell phone, which he had thrown inside the armrest storage, rang.\n\nHe looked down. It was a call from Lorenzo.\n\nXavier frowned, turned over his phone and clicked to hang up. He glanced in the rearview mirror again.\n\nBehind him was a flashy, black and red car, the world\u2019s rarest supercar. A toy owned by the richest man in Quill City.\n\nXavier looked at Sydney again. Her sobs could really melt a man's heart. He secretly gripped the steering wheel.\n\nIt was not Sydney who gave him her number first. The men, including him, noticed Lorenzo's indifference towards her, but were too captivated by her beauty, so they asked for it behind Lorenzo's back.\n\nOf course, they all found a perfect reason. They asked Sydney to leave her number, so they could contact her for business purposes.\n\nAt that time, no one dared to have filthy intentions. She was Lorenzo's legal wife, and Lorenzo was one of the most outstanding people among his friends.\n\nAside from the fact that Sydney was married, she was indeed a rare beauty. Everyone thought it was harmless to keep a beautiful woman\u2019s phone number.\n\nHowever, things were different now.\n\nHe swerved the steering wheel abruptly and turned around in the opposite direction. He accelerated to 200 miles an hour, and threw Lorenzo off his trail.\n\nChapter 0005\nXavier was driving dangerously fast, but his expression was exceptionally calm.\n\nIn addition to running several companies, he was also a part-time F2 racing driver.\n\nFor Lorenzo, the supercar was just a means of transportation, but in Xavier's hands, it was a toy. He was sure that Lorenzo would not be able to catch up.\n\nLorenzo watched Xavier's car zoom by his car like a ghost. He was stunned for a moment and quickly turned around. Two minutes later, he lost them.\n\nHe continued to call Xavier while flooring the accelerator, but still no one answered.\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier knew that he had other intentions when he ditched Lorenzo, but he dared not show it in front of Sydney right away.\n\nAfter all, she was still Lorenzo's wife. Xavier was one year younger than Lorenzo whom he regarded as his blood brother, so she was his sister-in-law, in a sense.\n\nHe took her to the hospital as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter the medical check-up to make sure there were no major problems, Xavier took Sydney back to Celestial Park after applying ice patches to her face.\n\nCelestial Park was a famous luxury residential area in Quill City. Sydney and Lorenzo bought their marital home here.\n\nAs soon as Sydney got to the bedroom, she saw Lorenzo sitting on the sofa at the end of the bed. There was a bottle of white wine on the round table next to him.\n\nSydney's eyes flashed. Without saying a word, she went to bed, lay down, and closed her eyes.\n\nA few seconds later, the man's footsteps were heard.\n\nSydney shivered. Her eyelashes became wet again.\n\nLorenzo suddenly got on the bed and pressed on her. She opened her eyes and started to push him away. \"Don't touch me...\"\n\nLorenzo paused, grabbed her collar with both hands, and tore her skirt apart.\n\nSydney's eyes widened with shock. Her screams echoed through the bedroom. \"Don't touch me with the hand you used to touch Chelsea Dune!\"\n\nLorenzo froze.\n\nSydney looked at him as tears poured down her face. \"I can have no dignity in front of you because we were dependent on each other for those four years. You provided a great deal for me, and you are also the closest person to me besides my mother and grandmother. My heart breaks for you because you were hurt by what happened back then. I can\u2019t bear to see you in deep pain every day because of me so I allow you to vent your grievances by hurting me!\n\n\u201cBut I can't share the same man with Chelsea, and I can't have the hand that touched her, touch me!!\n\n\u201cShe is the last straw of my dignity, Lorenzo!\"\n\nHowever, these words did not move Lorenzo to show any guilt.\n\nInstead, he became angrier. \"What about my last straw?\"\n\n\"I was disgusted by you too after Oliver touched you. What you do that night when we got registered?\"\n  \nSydney trembled. She choked.\n\nThat night.\n  \nHer mother and mother-in-law both wanted to seize the opportunity so that she and Lorenzo could have a child as soon as possible, so they tampered with their tea.\n\nLorenzo thought it was Sydney who Framed him.\n\n\"Why aren't you talking?\" Lorenzo's eyes were red as he stared into hers, \"Where did Xavier take you? He deliberately didn't answer my call. What did you do?\"\n\n\"Can you stop being suspicious of everyone and anyone? He took me to the hospital!\"\n\n\"Hospital?\" Lorenzo sneered, and he tightened his grip on her clothes, this time tearing her skirt all the way, \"Sydney, lift your legs for me!\"\n\nSydney panicked. \"What are you going to do?!\"\n\n\"Let's see if you betrayed me again!\"\n\nSydney immediately closed her knees together, \"I didn't!\"\n\nLorenzo pressed harder and his voice became more forceful, \"I don't believe a word you said!\"\n\nSuch stubborn words made Sydney lose the will to refute him.\n\nShe looked at Lorenzo\u2019s frightening and gloomy face and felt disgusted with him for the first time.\n\nShe reached out and pinched the back of his hand. \"Let me go, I'm tired, I want to sleep!\"\n\n\"I don't want to sleep, why should you sleep!\" Lorenzo was still furious. He did not seem to feel any pain in the back of his hand. The grip in his hand became stronger and stronger.\n\nHe pulled apart Sydney's knees quickly. He spread her legs apart so hard that even her behinds hurt.\n\nHe was worried that she would resist, so he pressed his knee on her belly and untied his belt.\n\nSydney's tears rolled to the side of her temples and wet the pillow. Still, she said nothing. Since pinching the back of his hand did not work, she pinched his neck hard.\n\nLorenzo winced in pain, but still did not let her go.\n\nIt felt as if he would not give up if he did not test her.\n\nLorenzo's neck,and even his arms and abdominal muscles were left bruised from Sydney's pinching while she gradually lost hope.\n\nShe wilted like dry roses, losing all trace of vitality.\n\nLorenzo endured the pain and tried to control her, but failed.\n\nSydney's tearful eyes trembled. Her hand squeezing his chest loosened, and she finally spoke again, \"Is that enough?\"\n\n\"Enough?\" Unexpectedly, Lorenzo felt even more enraged. He reached out and yanked open the drawer on the bedside table, took out the bottle of essential oil she bought, and then slammed the drawer shut!\n\nSydney seized this opportunity and tried to escape, but he grabbed her ankle in time. \"Be good!\"\n\nSydney stopped resisting. She knew she would not be able to escape tonight.\n\nShe was in tears, but she laughed. \"Lorenzo, I really didn't expect that one day I would be disgusted with you. Go ahead, disgust me more. So I can hate you enough, and give you what you want...\"\n\nShe thought, \u2018Lorenzo should know what I was referring to.\u2019\n\nIn the split second, her refusal to sign the divorce agreement suddenly wavered.\n\nDuring the time between being taken away by Xavier and being sent back home, she had been recalling the past.\n\nWhen she recalled the past with Chelsea, she did not want to lose her self-esteem. However, when she recalled every moment with Lorenzo, she did not want to regret losing the man she loved most.\n\nShe was deeply confused by these opposing feelings.\n\nHowever, right now, she actually felt disgusted with the man she loved most.\n\nShe was glad.\n\nDisgusted by him meant that she could finally let him go one day. \n\nLorenzo's face darkened at Sydney\u2019s words. He could not tell whether he was angry or something else.\n\nShe wanted to say more, but Lorenzo's lips suddenly covered hers.\n\nAt the same time, his fingertips of both hands trailed up along her waistline.\n\nThe faint smell of tobacco mixed with the fragrance and wine was an alluring masculine aroma. In the past, she could never resist his kisses.\n\nLorenzo was even wilder in the past than he is now. He was like a lion in the savanna. The passion and impulse he made her feel was strong and without restraint.\n\nApart from the four years they were separated, they had slept together for four years until now. He understood every part of her body, her preferred tension and pressure.\n\nSoon, her body reacted uncontrollably."

There were two pieces of good news to celebrate today: my 3rd wedding anniversary and the fact that I'd just gotten a promotion.\nI walk eagerly to the man I love, stretching onto my toes to kiss Ryan. But he ducks, pushing something into my arms.\nWhen I unwrapped it, my whole body froze.\nA divorce document.\n\u201cThat's what I want. \u201c Ryan said coldly. His arms crossed over his chest.\u201d Honestly, I'm sick and tired of this. You're not taking care of our home. \u201d\nIt took me a minute to comprehend the current situation.\u201d It wasn't April Fool's Day. \u201d\nExasperated, Ryan rolls his angry eyes at me and gestures to the room around us. \u201c Do you know what it\u2019s like to walk into a room with cat hair everywhere and a carpet that hasn\u2019t been cleaned in months? \u201d\nMy eyes widen, my head pulling back to look at my husband. \u201cLet me remind you that I make twice as much as you do and that I am the one who pays for the cleaners. Yet, I distinctly remember conversing with you a long time ago where we agreed to take turns dividing our workload!\u201d\nThe counter-argument makes Ryan grunt, throwing his head back as he stares at the ceiling. \u201cI earn money too, Esme!\u201d He snaps at me.\n\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem here?\u201d\n\u201cThe problem? Why don\u2019t I have a housewife? You can\u2019t even be bothered to bring me a child to raise!\u201d\n\u201cMe? You do realize I want to have this baby, too, right? You\u2019re the one who refuses to go with me to the hospital! Maybe if you were a bit more active\u2014\u201d\nRyan interrupts me with a laugh that silences me.\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d He spits, seemingly implying that I\u2019m a liar. \u201cYou\u2019re having an affair with your boss; don\u2019t deny it!\u201d\nMr. Anderson? Derek Anderson? The confusion seems to proliferate, and the facial expressions that take over my face feel like a dream.\nThe only thing that is true about my boss is that he\u2019s a dashing divorced man. I\u2019m dazed at the idea my husband accuses me of sneaking behind his back.\n\u201cI can absolutely assure you, Ryan, that there never has and never will be anything regarding my boss! I am his subordinate, and there\u2019s nothing left to discuss about Mr. Anderson!\u201d\nHis arms cross over his chest again, huffing. \u201cYou\u2019re so delusional that your work has given you everything you desire when, in fact, it is your boss.\u201d\n\u201cFine. You want this divorce and to live in your fantasy world where I\u2019m the villain? I\u2019ll sign your freaking divorce papers, but not right now. For now, I\u2019m going to find a competent lawyer to help me properly divide my property from you.\u201d\nI start rushing toward the front door, needing to escape this house, this man, this absurdity.\nBut I hear Ryan chasing me down the hall. \u201cEsme! Quit stalling for more time or to conjure up new lies. If you have a clean conscience, then you should sign the papers today.\u201d\nHe grabs my arm and whirls me around, and for the first time since I met Ryan, I don\u2019t recognize the man. His eyes are dark, his skin ice cold as his fingers wrap around my upper arm, and his voice full of disgust.\nI shake my head, ripping my arm from his grasp, slap my husband in the face, and I leave the house with papers in hand and my heart bleeding on the floor in front of the man.\nHappy anniversary to me.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to murder the scum!\u201d\nMy best friends, Annie and Lily, sit at the bar on either side of me. Ransom\u2019s Tavern is our favorite place to drown our sorrows, and Lily is basically ready to go all Jeffery Dahmer on Ryan.\n\u201cAnd on your anniversary of all days! Who asks for a divorce on the day two people get married? He better be ready for me because I\u2019m going to end his entire life with one freaking punch to the face!\u201d\nI can\u2019t help but laugh at Lily as she puts up her fists like she\u2019s preparing for battle. Her nose scrunches up, and her eyebrows hide behind her brown bangs.\n\u201cCalm yourself,\u201d Annie instructs our friend.\n\u201cCalm? How can you be calm? He\u2019s just told our best friend that she\u2019s only where she is in her career because she\u2019s been sleeping with her boss! Do you know how incredibly misogynistic and disgusting that is?\u201d\n\u201cTalk louder; I don\u2019t think the entire block heard you,\u201d I reply as I take a drink. This is the last thing I need. I rub my left temple, my curly blonde hair quickly becoming tangled in my fingers.\n\u201cMoving on!\u201d Annie instructs, waving her perfectly manicured hand at Lily. Then, touching my hand on the sticky bar, Annie states seriously, \u201cEsme, if I were you, I\u2019d go to your boss\u2019 house and sleep with him. Now.\u201d\nI roll my eyes as I give the two women a sad smile. \u201cCome on, my boss isn\u2019t like you, guys. He\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s got a lot of responsibilities on his plate.\u201d\n\u201cUh, isn\u2019t your boss single now?\u201d Lily questions.\nI shrug, taking another sip of my watery beer. \u201cHe\u2019s got two daughters, and from what I\u2019ve heard, he takes care of them independently.\u201d\n\u201cAka, he\u2019s single and maybe ready to mingle?\u201d Annie teases, biting her bottom lip at her joke.\nI nudge my shoulder against hers, unable to keep a laugh from rising out of me. \u201cStop it!\u201d\nI wouldn\u2019t be shocked if Anderson is single, especially since he never works overtime. He always leaves as soon as the clock strikes five like Cinderella leaving the ball at midnight.\nBut as I sit here, I start to wonder if the booze has already saturated my mind. Because suddenly, Anderson is all I\u2019m able to think about.\nWho would it hurt if I were to maybe\u2026text him? Ryan would be furious, absolutely floored at my gall. But my anger, my desire to hurt the man who I\u2019d married three years ago, fuels my rage.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to text him,\u201d I tell the girls, pulling out my phone. I\u2019m going to tell him exactly where I am right now and use this to relieve some of the anger.\nGetting back at Ryan for his selfish and pathetic behavior? Better than giving him a swift kick in his special little place.\n\u201cNo way. Prove it!\u201d Annie smirks, looking down at my phone lying on the bar.\nI pick up the phone, typing in Anderson\u2019s name in my messages. I\u2019ll send him my address as if supposedly informing a friend of my whereabouts. Then, after about a minute, I\u2019ll just tell him I\u2019d sent the message to the wrong person.\nNo harm, no foul.\nBesides, it\u2019s already 8:45. It must be parenting time for Anderson.\nI type in the address to Ransom\u2019s Tavern and hit send. I put down the phone, my friends laughing and shoving me with disbelief.\nTo my surprise, my phone buzzes back immediately with a reply.\n\u201cFive minutes.\u201d\n\nChapter 2\n\u201cNo way, no way!\u201d Annie squeals as she grabs my phone from my hands. Her pale blue eyes sparkle with mischief. \u201cLily, he\u2019s coming!\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Lily shouts, reaching across me to take my phone next, pushing a piece of her short brown hair away from her face.\n\u201cThis is absolutely crazy. I can\u2019t even believe it! Five minutes? That\u2019s so fast!\u201d Annie cries, her arm catapulting back for the phone.\n\u201cOh my God, I\u2019m so excited, I can\u2019t wait to see what he looks like!\u201d Lily adds, jumping in her bar seat with excitement.\nThe two of them are growing louder by the second, and now I\u2019m starting to get a headache and regret my message.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you just point out that he\u2019s got two daughters? It\u2019s a school night. He\u2019s probably spending time with the kids,\u201d Lily points out as Annie re-reads the texts for the tenth time.\n\u201cWhat do you think this means?\u201d Annie asks, still staring at my phone.\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll bring them along,\u201d Lily gushes.\nI\u2019m too stunned to say anything. Did I really do this to myself? I can\u2019t even believe it!\nAs if a magic wand is waved over my head, I feel the drunkenness clears up instantly, and now I\u2019m sweating from every possible place I can think of.\n\u201cHe\u2026he must have thought I was contacting him for a work-related matter,\u201d I find myself stammering to the girls. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly dedicated.\u201d\nAnnie shakes her head. \u201cExcept this is outside of work hours, honey. Besides, he knows this is a pub, yet here he is, rushing over like your knight in shining armor!\u201d\nShe and Lily scream again, their bodies jumping up and down in the bar seats as they shake their arms in the air.\nWell, if the drunkenness has left, then bring on the hangover because I am far too sober for this.\nI\u2019m honestly speechless now. My friends must be overthinking things, surely. I mean, Anderson is just so professional in the office. He cares for his subordinates, and I know that.\nBesides, I\u2019ve never messaged him outside of the working hours in the past, so that must have made him inclined to believe it must be something serious.\nEven if that\u2019s not the case, I can\u2019t help but continue panicking in my head over the fact Anderson will be here soon.\nAs the end of the five minutes approaches, Lily and Annie decide to step aside to let me handle this situation on my own. They sit at a table in the back of the bar, watching me like I\u2019m their newest form of entertainment.\nI better come up with a perfect lie. I\u2019m starting to sweat and growing more nervous by the second for Anderson to show up. Maybe something about how work has been a struggle, or I\u2019ve had a few difficult clients?\nAs the thoughts run through my head, they\u2019re quickly sent away when Anderson walks into the bar in an elegant, perfectly tailored suit. His eyes search for me before landing on the bar, and he smiles gently.\nStanding at what I can imagine to be over six feet tall, Derek Anderson is a white yet tanned man in his late thirties with dark brown hair on his head. He has his usual dark smudges under his eyes, which match his exhaustion. He\u2019s also just about one of the most good-looking men I\u2019ve ever seen.\nI quickly scramble to my feet once he enters, realizing I have absolutely no idea what I must look like. A wreck, probably, considering I just got dumped by my own husband. Is my hair okay? What about my makeup?\nOh man, what about my breath?\nAnderson approaches, keeping his smile spread out on his face. I take a deep breath, and tell myself to calm down.\n\u201cCongratulations on your promotion, Esme,\u201d Anderson says once he\u2019s closed the distance. He looks really good tonight.\n\u201cT-Thank you,\u201d I stutter out, trying to keep my composure. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to taking on the new responsibilities.\u201d\nWe both sit at the bar together, still keeping one another in our line of sight.\nI do put a lot of time into my job, and it is genuinely rewarding and fulfilling. I mean, the years I\u2019ve put into it have given me such a rush of pride. But thinking of Ryan\u2019s complaints scratches at the surface of my skin.\n\u201cI brought you a gift to celebrate,\u201d Anderson states, holding out a small bag for me to take from him.\nSurprised, I reached out for the bag. What could he have possibly grabbed for me in the five minutes it took for him to arrive?\n\u201cThank you, Mr. Anderson, that\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d\nHe gestures to the bag. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you open it?\u201d\nI look down at the bag, feeling awkward about opening his gift right here, but do as he asks.\nI can\u2019t contain my absolute shock when I pull the gift out of the bag. A jewelry box?\nI slowly open the box, seeing a beautiful necklace inside. My jaw drops.\n\u201cW-w-what? How did you\u2014?\u201d\nAnderson gives me a sheepish smile, nodding at the box. \u201cI happened to notice your phone\u2019s wallpaper recently, and\u2026\u201d He rubs the back of his neck. \u201cI hope that it wasn\u2019t too personal.\u201d\nI can\u2019t hide my stunned expression. This is so thoughtful of Anderson, and I raise my eyes to his. How do I even thank him for this?\nThe necklace, a beautiful silver chain with a dark blue heart wrapped around it, was supposed to be a gift hint for Ryan to find. I picked it out because I knew how perfect it would match my own dark blue eyes.\nI\u2019ve been eyeing this for weeks and was so, so hopeful he would figure out my desire to own it.\nI\u2019m so confused because this is like my dream wedding anniversary! Though, in reality, it\u2019s all a mess\u2014yet here I stand with my own boss, my eyes wide and mouth agape as I hold onto the beautiful jewelry.\nThis is Anderson handing over this gift, though. Not my own husband.\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting a divorce!\u201d I blurt out without a thought.\nMy boss\u2019s expression morphs, and he gives off a strange expression. \u201cSorry?\u201d He questions.\nAt this very moment, I notice something pink on the corner of Anderson\u2019s suit. Is that\u2026Peppa Pig? A sticker?\nGod, what the heck am I doing? This is my boss! He\u2019s a mature man with children and professional conduct. A full-fledged, single father with no need for some random employee to take up his incredibly important time.\nI take one deep breath, then another. Calm down a second. This day has been such a whirlwind that I must have gotten swept up in the kind gesture from Anderson.\nMy nerves are growing, and I feel inexplicably and desperately wanting to escape this incredibly awkward situation. My personal life doesn\u2019t need to be brought up in front of Anderson, so what am I doing talking to him like we\u2019re old friends catching up?\nOut of professionalism, it\u2019s imperative that my personal matters are handled privately and have nothing to do with him. What am I even doing calling him to the bar and divulging that I\u2019m leaving Ryan behind?\nAbruptly, I make my voice sound natural, though it doesn\u2019t feel as such. \u201cWhat I meant to say was,\u201d I start, another breath to calm myself. \u201cI\u2019d like to request time off.\u201d\nAnderson raises his left eyebrow.\nI nearly cough. \u201cI need to handle the\u2026related paperwork, if that\u2019s okay, sir?\u201d\nIt feels like a bowling ball has landed on my chest as I watch his expression go unchanging. God, of all the times, to sound like a complete bumbling mess, it has to be in front of my boss.\n\nChapter 3\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d Anderson asks after the silence becomes too stuffy. He\u2019s frowning slightly, and I notice his posture slightly worsen.\nIn my head, I\u2019m thinking, What else? After all, when he arrived, he had no clue about my fight with Ryan. Does he even know today was our anniversary?\nFor some reason, as I continue to stare at the man, I feel a sense of something. Is it\u2026disappointment? Why?\nInstead of probing him with more questions, I nod my head up at the tall man. His eyes, dark and honestly somewhat mysterious, crash against my skin like a hot laser burning into me.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all, yes,\u201d I finally reply.\nI look at Anderson, and then my eyes drift over to Annie and Lily in the corner of the bar. They\u2019re watching so intensely you\u2019d think they've never seen two people interact before. I feel severe discomfort with their daggers.\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Anderson says, straightening his suit jacket. \u201cYour time off is approved. If there is anything else I can do for you, please let me know.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I say to him, wanting to give a smile but struggling to let myself give one away. He\u2019s a kind man, and I appreciate his understanding.\n\u201cOf course. Though, I have one more question, Esme.\u201d\nI turn my head to the side at the statement.\n\u201cAre you here alone tonight?\u201d Anderson\u2019s voice seems to warble a bit, and it throws me off for a moment. Did it matter if I\u2019m here by myself or not?\nNot wanting to lie but still feeling a bit nervous, I nod my head again. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d\nAnderson stands back up to depart, wiping something off of his jacket. As he does this, a waiter comes up to me and deposits a drink in front of me.\n\u201cOh, no, I didn\u2019t order\u2014\u201d I start to say, unsure where this mystery drink came from.\n\u201cCharge it double and put it on my tab,\u201d Anderson deadpans, handing over his card to the waiter, who quickly swipes it through and gives it back.\n\u201cSir, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d\nBefore I can speak, Anderson returns the card to his pocket. \u201cGoodnight, Esme. I hope your paperwork is sorted out shortly.\u201d\n\u201cBut sir, you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d I\u2019m sputtering, but he holds up his hand to stop my sentence again.\n\u201cEnjoy your night.\u201d\nAnderson then walks out of the bar alone, and I can\u2019t help but stare in disbelief at the man as he disappears behind the walls. What the heck just happened?\nThat was all so weird, and I\u2019m struggling to find any words to say now that I\u2019ve been left alone at the bar.\nIt takes another few seconds, but Annie and Lily come rushing over with bright eyes. I can tell the two are ready to start interrogating me for what happened between us, but in truth, I don\u2019t have any words for them.\nInstead, all I can do is gesture with my hands at what is before me. The necklace, the drink, and my confusion are all present.\nI want to tell them I don\u2019t know what happened, but I think my face is saying that enough. Because I don\u2019t know anything. This was all just\u2026random?\nLily, snickering to herself, mimics Anderson under her breath with her large smile. \u201cI\u2019ll pay double.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d Annie pushes, and I just shrug.\n\u201cOh, come on! He walks in here and hands you some fancy jewelry and then hands over his card without even knowing what you\u2019re drinking. That was him clearly flirting!\u201d Lily says dreamily.\n\u201cHardly,\u201d my voice croaks.\n\u201cHow many men would come into this bar and do the exact same thing, though, Esme?\u201d Annie insists. \u201cThat man just swept you off your feet!\u201d\nI look at the door where Anderson exited, wanting to ask him what is going through his head. But that\u2019s the issue. Now he\u2019s left again, and I\u2019m left wondering what this day has turned into.\nA freaking fiasco, for sure.\nLater, after finally getting Lily and Annie to let me leave the bar and return home, I climb into my empty bed.\nAlone for the first time in years, I feel helpless over my foreseeable future. It\u2019s hard to judge whether things will be good or not with Ryan already pushing and shoving his way out the door.\nWhat am I supposed to do about all of this? Today should have been perfect. Ryan could have swept me off my feet, and we could have had a romantic dinner together, shared gifts and kisses and laughter, and enjoyed ourselves. Instead, here I am, holding back tears against my pillow.\nI got a promotion, and on my wedding anniversary at the age of 30, I\u2019m about to lose my marriage. What\u2019s worse is I\u2019m still childless, which causes my heart to strain. I don\u2019t want that label. I don\u2019t want that nightmare.\nNow, I\u2019m going to be the divorced single woman everywhere I try to go.\nOr, maybe, a single, divorced career woman.\nThough, that seems to be even more stressful than the divorced woman label.\nI shake my head out on the pillow, throwing my face into the sheet. This is all happening so bloody fast that I\u2019m unsure what else to do.\nAnd on top of everything bad that\u2019s happened today, I can\u2019t stop replaying Anderson\u2019s facial expressions and kindness toward me. He\u2019s a genuinely kind individual, so having him attempt to comfort me was sympathetic.\nI can\u2019t imagine Ryan doing the same for me, even if we are still married. His compassionate side has never been his strong suit.\nThen again, maybe I\u2019ve just been wearing rose-tinted glasses the whole time, and he was never a good husband to begin with. I guess it\u2019s possible to be lost in a world of love.\nGrunting and rolling over to get out of bed, I realize that sleep shall continue to evade unless I do something about it.\nGrabbing my wallet and a light jacket to cover my pajamas, I finally exit my place, trudging downstairs and out into the world to fix this incredibly horrid headache and insomnia.\nAround the corner from my place is a 24-hour convenience store. Maybe the clinic will have the meds I\u2019m looking for. Regardless, I\u2019m so over this day, and I just want to sleep and have it be tomorrow.\nThe best way forward is through, after all.\nI shuffle into the clinic, making my way to the medication section. I tend to pick up whatever the strongest medications happen to be on the shelf.\nAt this rate, they\u2019re going to need to make a simple medication to calm my anxiety, too.\nMaybe I should go back to the doctor. My insomnia hasn\u2019t really corrupted my sleep and made me this tired in years. But clearly, I\u2019ll be struggling for the foreseeable future.\nI shuffle into the next aisle to grab a large bottle of water to take with my meds. As I get to the front of the store to pay for my supplies, I hear a voice I recognize.\n\u201cIs this the right one, you think?\u201d He asks another person nearby.\nI stretch my neck, seeing the one person I\u2019m desperately trying not to think about.\nI see the short haired blonde first, and I\u2019m surprised to see Ryan standing in the aisle just to the left of me. Then, I hear a second voice.\n\u201cMaybe we get this one,\u201d she replies.\nI narrow my eyes, and as I thank the man at the counter, I walk over to the two people.\nIt\u2019s Ryan alright, but the person he\u2019s with?\nMy cousin, Melinda. With her picture-perfect beauty and her short black hair pulled into a pathetic excuse for a ponytail, I look at the two of them down the aisle.\nAnd the object they\u2019re talking about is a freaking test stick?\n\nChapter 4\n\u201cYou really had to do this to me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Melinda complains as they pick up another stick to examine. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have used protection before you got the divorce?\u201d\n\u201cBabe, it\u2019s going to be fine because we\u2019re going to be divorced soon! Esme\u2014that freaking foolish woman\u2014she\u2019s got no idea about us! Besides, she\u2019s got significantly more savings than I do, and soon, we\u2019re going to inherit a fortune!\u201d\n\u201cYou better hope so, dummy,\u201d Melinda grunts as she turns the pink box over in her hands. \u201cThis is stressing me out.\u201d\n\u201cLook, we\u2019ll inherit the money, we\u2019ll be rich, and you and I will be together. You should get knocked up immediately, unlike Esme. She can\u2019t even have kids!\u201d\nI feel my heart turn cold, my skin burns, and my anger blinds me. This cheater! This whole time, I thought our main issue was over not having children!\nMy fingers strain around the bottles I hold, and a million different things cross my mind to screech at these two people; people I trusted!\nThis entire marriage has never hindered kids; it\u2019s only ever been for Ryan to divorce me and take my money! That spineless, pathetic scum.\n\u201cMelinda! What the heck?\u201d I screech at the two, giving away my position. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you got into bed with him!\u201d\nThe two of them turn to look at me, eyebrows raised, and, at least in my cousin\u2019s face, a slight hint of fear.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Ryan demands.\n\u201cHearing you plan your new life.\u201d I glower at my soon-to-be ex-husband. \u201cYou really think I\u2019m this foolish?\u201d\n\u201cOh no, I don\u2019t think it, I know it!\u201d Ryan retorts back.\nI look straight at my cousin, my eyes falling into slits as I speak the truth. \u201cI don\u2019t have children. No. But maybe that\u2019s because this man\u2019s got useless seeds.\u201d\nI jab a finger in Ryan\u2019s direction. \u201cI won\u2019t let you parasites take a single penny from me! This is freaking war.\u201d\nI stomp out of the pharmacy with a new purpose and officially wide awake. I\u2019m not letting this ship go down. Just the opposite: I\u2019m going to ruin their lives.\nI\u2019m getting a lawyer, gathering all the evidence, and I\u2019m taking them down every peg possible.\nBut first, I need to move out of this place. The thought of Ryan and Melinda doing it in my bed makes me want to vomit.\nI spend the night putting together what I can find, refusing to let sleep take me away from my work.\nOnce the sun comes up, I start chugging coffee, heading into the office to ask if any of my colleagues know anything about nearby rental options.\nI let myself get lost in my job and rental searches, frantic as I let the day whiz by me. It\u2019s not until I stop for a moment in the daze of anger and work that I realize two things:\nThe first one is that I told Anderson I needed time off, and I still came into the office today.\nThe second one is that it\u2019s almost five, and I have two messages from my boss asking me to come to his office when I have a moment.\n\u201cHeck!\u201d I whisper. I stand up abruptly, grab my phone, and throw it into my pocket, rushing down the hall to Anderson\u2019s office. God, this is going to look really weird, isn\u2019t it?\nI knock on the door and straighten myself out, but in my head, I know I\u2019m going to look like a mess.\n\u201cCome in,\u201d I hear Anderson call, and I slowly open the door.\n\u201cHi,\u201d I say shyly, moving forward into the room.\n\u201cAh, Esme,\u201d he smiles. He gestures at me. \u201cCome in, close the door behind you.\u201d\nOh God, am I being fired?\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, I didn\u2019t see your messages until just now. I was busy with my work.\u201d\nHe nods but tells me to sit down. \u201cNo problem, I just wanted to discuss something with you.\u201d\nThe moment my body touches the soft cushion of the chair, I\u2019m quick to explain. \u201cI completely forgot that I\u2019d asked for time off, and then I didn\u2019t even remember until I read your messages! I\u2019m so sorry for\u2014\u201d\nHe holds up a hand to stop me, and I listen, confused. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I called you in here.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d I say, shrinking into the chair. If I could just disappear into thin air right now, that\u2019d be wonderful.\n\u201cI did, however, want to ask you if you\u2019re alright. You do seem a bit\u2026tense.\u201d\nI need the power of invisibility right about now.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I lie.\n\u201cAnd the conversations around the office about you looking for rental options?\u201d\nHeck, I\u2019ve been caught.\n\u201cAre you looking for a place, Esme?\u201d He asks again.\nHe must have listened in on one of those conversations because I only spoke to a few people, and they were relatively short ones.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, really, I hope you can understand that this has been a difficult time for me. I\u2019m sorry for discussing personal matters during work hours.\u201d\nHe raises his hands to me to calm me.\n\u201cEsme, take a breath. It\u2019s fine; we have a comprehensive employee care system.\u201d Anderson gives me a deep look, seemingly looking for something. \u201cConsidering your\u2026special situation, the company has some housing allowances for employees.\u201d\nI sit up straighter. \u201cReally?\u201d\nThe man nods. \u201cYes.\u201d\nI let a long sigh out. \u201cOh, wow, okay, thank you, sir. And thank you for not telling anyone about the divorce. I haven\u2019t told anyone, and I\u2019m not exactly ready for the entire thing to go public.\u201d\nHe nods again. \u201cThat\u2019s tough, and I understand.\u201d\nI feel compelled to apologize again; this information on the housing is incredibly helpful, and I\u2019m so sleep-deprived that it actually seems like a good idea to shake his hand and give him a hug.\nGet your things together, Esme.\nHis small smile and that nod, however, make me feel a special spark ripple through me. Finally, someone understands and has given me the best encouragement I\u2019ve received yet.\nI\u2019m so grateful for his kindness, but a few tears prickle the corners of my eyes. Something about his stature and genuine concern for my well-being and home life makes me feel closer to Anderson than to my own friends.\n\u201cI appreciate the information and for everything you\u2019ve done for me, sir.\u201d\n\u201cMy best employee deserves to know that she is a valuable member to the team. If you\u2019re not in top fighting shape, then we all lose, correct?\u201d\nI nod vigorously. \u201cOf course, yes.\u201d\n\u201cVery well. Go speak to Mrs. Halloway on the third floor about your housing request, and she should be able to get everything sorted out for you today. Hurry, though, she\u2019ll be leaving any minute.\u201d\nI jump up, and without really thinking, I get moving, calling over my shoulder my appreciation once more.\nAs I rush down the stairs, I remind myself that Anderson is also divorced. He\u2019s even got two little girls to take care of. Maybe, this is a shared sympathy?\nHe must know the torture I\u2019ve been enduring since Ryan\u2019s heinous words last night. A divorce is a painful process.\nI believe, however, that my situation is guaranteed worse than anyone will know.\nI manage to catch Mrs. Halloway as she\u2019s putting her papers together to leave. She is kind enough to sit with me for twenty minutes after five as we sign papers, and I\u2019m given the keys to a new apartment to live in.\nI call Annie and Lily in hopes the two women can help me move out tonight. The sooner I\u2019m out of this place, the better.\nAs we\u2019re putting my things into boxes as quickly as possible, the girls prod me with a bunch of questions.\nClearly, everything is moving quickly to them.\n\u201cYou said this is company-provided housing?\u201d Annie asks, incredulous.\n\nChapter 5\nI smile, pushing some curly blonde hair behind my ear and out of my eyes. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d\n\u201cHow much is your rent going to cost?\u201d Lily jumps in.\nI think for a second, putting books into another box. \u201cUh, about two thousand.\u201d\nLily throws a pillow at me, pursing her red lips in my direction as she waves her arms around in the air. \u201cI\u2019m going to murder you!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I laugh, unsure what she\u2019s talking about.\n\u201cI never envied your promotion; everyone knows how hard you work. If I worked late like you, my face would collapse!\u201d\nAnnie says, \u201cBut this, I cannot forgive you for!\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I question, hands on my waist.\nThe two girls look at one another before returning their gazes to me.\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Annie replies, rolling her eyes.\n\u201cCity center,\u201d Lily ticks on her finger.\n\u201cOne thousand square meters,\u201d Annie says next.\n\u201cFully furnished apartment.\u201d\n\u201cSwimming pool, security, a gym downstairs.\u201d\n\u201cOnly 100 meters from the closest shopping center!\u201d\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to kick you out after you\u2019ve signed the contract.\u201d Lily crosses her arms with a satisfying smirk on her face.\nI roll my eyes and sigh but understand they\u2019re having fun at my expense. \u201cGirls, this is the employee care system, okay? I\u2019m getting a divorce.\u201d\nI point at Lily. \u201cAnd you? With one handsome boyfriend after another.\u201d Then, I point at the tall blonde. \u201cAnd you, with a husband that absolutely adores you! Life is fair for the two of you, and there\u2019s no need to be jealous of my pathetic life.\u201d\nI let myself fall to the ground with my legs crossed, exhausted.\nAnnie approaches me, her hand on my shoulder. \u201cWe know, hon,\u201d she reassures me.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re sorry you\u2019re going through all of this right now,\u201d Lily adds, joining us on the floor.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to keep you as happy as we can,\u201d the first woman insists. \u201cYou\u2019re our best friend, Esme, and we just want you to smile.\u201d\nI take both girls around the shoulders and hold them close, so thankful to have the two greatest friends on the planet.\n\u201cWhat the heck would I do without you two?\u201d\nLily shrugs against my embrace. \u201cYou\u2019d probably be packing this place by yourself?\u201d\nAnnie nods matter-of-factly. \u201cAlso, no one would be here to taunt you.\u201d\n\u201cOr remind you that Ryan\u2019s a loser, and you\u2019re a thousand times better off without him!\u201d\n\u201cPlus, then you\u2019d have no one to invite to your new, beautiful, stunning apartment!\u201d Annie finishes, clapping her hands together as I let them both go.\n\u201cYou two are absolutely ridiculous!\u201d I roll my eyes.\n\u201cBut you love us!\u201d They sing song together.\nIt takes only a few hours of rushed packing to get out of the house I\u2019ve lived in for the past several years. I look around one more time once the girls have left, saying goodbye to pieces of my home that will no longer be mine.\nThe perfect window perch to look out at the view around me.\nThe spot on the wooded living room floor where I\u2019d spilled just a touch of black nail polish.\nThe perfect shower and bath combo that I used to lie in for hours at a time enjoying the calm.\nThe walk-in closet is mostly barren now.\nThe steps that I\u2019d tripped down the first time I got a promotion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to say goodbye,\u201d I whisper to the house. The creaks and the shadows that I\u2019ve grown so used to will just become a faded memory. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d\nA creak in the ceiling sounds as if the home is replying to my final words.\n\u201cThank you for these past few years,\u201d I finish, standing in the middle of the living room and taking one final deep breath in.\nThen, I take off my wedding ring and place it on the kitchen table next to my house key. This is it. This is the end of my story here.\nI grab my car keys off the counter by the front door, take one more look around, and then I finally make my exit, knowing there\u2019s no chance I\u2019ll ever walk through this door again.\nI\u2019m no longer Esme, Ryan\u2019s wife.\nNow I\u2019m Esme, a strong, independent woman who is relearning the world around her.\n\u201cYou took your sweet time,\u201d Lily taunts as I finally get into my car downstairs.\n\u201cJust needed to say goodbye,\u201d I insist.\n\u201cOnly you would say goodbye to a freaking house,\u201d Annie says, poking my arm from the passenger seat. Her nails are white today, and I swat her hand away.\n\u201cLet\u2019s gooo, come on!\u201d Lily cries, holding out the second word to annoy us. She jumps up and down in the backseat. \u201cOnward to new adventures, Esme!\u201d\nThe drive to the new apartment isn\u2019t too far. It\u2019s about ten minutes away from the house, and surprisingly, it\u2019s pretty close to our favorite dive, Ransom\u2019s Tavern. That\u2019s pretty perfect since it\u2019s the middle point for all three of us.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Annie whispers as she looks out the window on her side of the car. \u201cLook how beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you said the city center, you really meant it,\u201d I reply to the two, leaning forward in my car to see the apartment building as it towers over us.\n\u201cThe name fits well, too,\u201d Lily adds, pointing out the window ahead of us. I follow her gaze as I see the plaque.\n\u201cCenter City Apartments.\u201d\n\u201cThis is nuts,\u201d I say without really thinking about it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling us,\u201d Lily huffs. \u201cHeck, Esme.\u201d\nWe get a parking spot to the elevators closest to where my unit is supposed to be, and the girls and I start planning our attack.\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s get the important stuff into the bedroom first, and then we\u2019ll grab everything else and put it in the living room,\u201d I instruct.\n\u201cGood plan,\u201d Annie nods, pulling her straight, blonde hair into a ponytail.\nWe spend about an hour just bringing things up to the apartment, moving quickly and laughing with one another about how dumb we all look doing this.\n\u201cHire movers next time!\u201d Lily grunts as she drops a box of clothes on the ground. \u201cIf I\u2019d known this was how I was spending tonight, I\u2019d have told you I was busy!\u201d\nAnnie bumps our friend as she walks by with another box of pictures and memorabilia. \u201cAt least if she hired movers, they\u2019d probably be hot!\u201d\nLily gasps. \u201cOh God, yes! They\u2019d probably be all hot and sweaty and look amazing. Instead, I stink, and I\u2019m tired and hungry!\u201d\nI throw the closest object at Lily, which just so happens to be my car keys. \u201cYou love me, and you\u2019d never leave me in the lurch.\u201d\nAnnie and Lily both shrug at the same time, and the three of us head back to the car for the final round of transferring my stuff.\nOnce we\u2019re done, the two girls decide to utilize the fully furnished couches, but I end up kicking them out so they can each go home and spend time with their men.\n\u201cCall us later if you need some talk therapy?\u201d Annie asks.\nI give her a hug. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me, I\u2019ll be sleeping for the next four days,\u201d Lily deadpans, so I shove her playfully before giving her a hug and watching the two head off together.\nI look around the apartment, not sure where to start. Maybe the best step is to be neighborly and go greet the people who live next store.\nI head out of the door and go to put my new key in my side pocket. However, I accidentally drop the metal onto the ground and crouch down to pick it up.\nSuddenly, as I\u2019m picking up the key, a little missile comes barreling toward me, and the blur crashes into my arms before falling to the ground.\nInstincts take over, and I quickly pick up the small child, an adorable little girl with dark hair. Instantly, she begins to cry as I hold her close and stand back up.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay!\u201d I tell her, bouncing her. \u201cDon\u2019t cry!\u201d\nI look around for an adult, but I\u2019m only met with another girl, a few years older than the first, who looks like a carbon copy. However, she is glaring at me.\n\u201cHow dare you make my sister cry!\u201d She shouts out. \u201cI\u2019m telling my dad on you!\u201d\nThen, as the older girl is yelling, a man in a bathrobe comes running out of the apartment next door, calling out his apologies for his daughter scaring me.\nThe first thing I see is a set of perfect abs, and I have a hard time pulling away from the sight. Wow, what a handsome set of abs.\nMy eyes move up from the abs to the eyes of the tall, tanned man. He looks incredibly relaxed and handsome as he stands in front of me, but it takes me about five seconds longer than it should to put it together.\nI can\u2019t help but gulp as I set down the girl in my arms.\nMy boss\u2026he\u2019s my neighbor?!"

                      "text": "Chapter 0001\nIt was ten o'clock in the evening. Sydney Castro sat in front of the dressing table, rubbing essential oils on her body for that glowing skin.\n\nClearly, she was getting ready to please a man.\n\nHer husband, whom she had not seen for two years, was returning to Somerland today. She missed him terribly.\n\nSydney oiled every part of her body until she was soft and smooth. Then she put on a white, furry lingerie set with a cheeky little cat tail on the small of her back.\n\nIn truth, she did not have to go to such trouble in the past. Lorenzo had wished he could stick to her every day, but after that fateful day, everything changed.\n\nShe went from being his closest lover to the woman he hated the most.\n\nLater, their elders arranged for them to get married. However, Lorenzo was so reluctant that he left the country the day after signing their marriage certificate.\n\nNow two years have passed, during which he only contacted her once. It was six months after her mother's death that he sent her a divorce agreement.\n\nSydney did not sign the papers. She still harbored thoughts of rekindling her marriage with Lorenzo.\n\nHowever, it was difficult.\n\nShe was not even aware he was returning tonight. She only found out when she saw Lorenzo\u2019s friends posted about their drinking session on social media.\n\nLater, she called her mother-in-law, who helped her and sent a driver to bring Lorenzo back.\n\nThe driver called. Lorenzo would be home in a few minutes.\n\nShe had to seize this opportunity and try to rekindle their old flame again.\n\nIntentionally dressed up, she knelt on fours by the bed, evenly distributing the rose petals that had been sprinkled on the bed in advance. She was so engrossed that she did not notice a long shadow walking in.\n\nSuddenly, Sydney\u2019s cat tail was yanked hard as a hot-blooded torso pressed on her back. Her heart skipped a beat. She turned back and came face-to-face with a deep yet intense set of piercing eyes.\n\n\"Enzo...\" she began delicately, \"You finally came...\" Back.\n\nThe rest of her sentence was choked back by a kiss reeking of ethanol.\n\nSydney's eyelashes fluttered as her body responded to his. She was not sure whether Lorenzo was drunk or if her outfit tonight was a success. \n\nLorenzo kissed her so passionately that he wanted to suck her lips swollen. He placed his hands over her waist , grabbing them vigorously.\n\nThe man seemed satisfied. While taking a breath, he growled in a whisper. \"good...\"\n\nGrowling in a whisper was considered flirting. That was Lorenzo\u2019s special habit. \n\nRecently, she had been doing yoga. Her figure was way better than two years ago. This was also a surprise for Lorenzo. His words and actions ignited the fire in her heart.\n\nHer plump waist rose and fell violently. Her rapid breath escaped her rosy lips. Her glowy, fair hands explored his waist through his custom silk shirt, caressing his hard and steamy muscles for the first time in a long time. She hurriedly unbuttoned his shirt.\n\nThe smooth material slid down his strong arms. She unbuckled his belt and wrapped her legs around his waist.\n\nEight years of familiarity with each other made them very compatible in bed. No need for any fluff, they went straight into it.\n\nPerhaps it was because they had not seen each other for too long. His desire seemed to be even more intense than hers, just like when he first tasted the forbidden fruit eight years ago. The man was excited and tireless.\n\nThis went on for more than three hours. Finally, he was satisfied.\n\nSydney laid on the man's beautiful sculpted chest and kissed his handsome face obsessively, trying to make up for lost time.\n\nLorenzo kept his eyes closed, allowing her kisses.\n\n \"I'm very pleased with you tonight.\"Lorenzo said\n\nSydney smiled and kissed the corner of his lips again.\n\nLorenzo raised the corners of his lips. He grabbed her waist hard, and turned over to hold her down.\n\nSydney was sure that he was in a good mood now.\n\nShe stretched out her hand to rub his Adam's apple. Right before they did it again, she said bluntly, \"Enzo, four years ago\u2026I swear nothing happened between Oliver and I. My body and soul completely belong to you. You are finally back. Can we please forget what happened that day and move forward together?\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the smile on the man's face froze instantly.\n\nLorenzo raised his hand and grabbed Sydney\u2019s throat. \n\nSydney's heart skipped a beat. She widened her eyes in panic. It was over. She had said the wrong thing.\n\nThis happened twice before. If she mentioned the words \"four years ago\", Lorenzo would immediately become ruthless and sinister.\n\nHer best friend once said that Lorenzo's reaction was akin to PTSD, a post-traumatic stress reaction.\n\nShe had doubts at the time, and it turned out to be the same today, which proved that her best friend was right.\n\nIn a daze, she heard Lorenzo say, \"Move forward with me? You?\n\n\"I touched you tonight because I'm afraid that you,  wouldn\u2019t change your disgusting habit and sleep with my friends again!\"\n\n\"I won't, I didn\u2019t...\" Sydney explained and reached out to touch his hand, attempting to soothe him.\n\nLorenzo's hand tightened, \"Don't touch me!\"\n\nSydney's face was red from Lorenzo\u2019s grip on her throat.\n\nLorenzo took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. \"You'd better sign the divorce agreement as soon as possible. The past love we had will never be rekindled.\"\n\n The words \u2018divorce agreement\u2019 stabbed Sydney\u2019s heart like a sword. She looked up anxiously, and said with difficulty, \"We were so good back then. Are you going to completely deny all that I\u2019ve done for you, just because of that incident?\n\n\"Oliver and I both explained back then that nothing happened to us. We were set up!\"\n\nHowever, the more she explained, the angrier Lorenzo became. His hand went up her neck and grabbed her chin. The force in his grip became stronger and stronger. Sydney could feel that he wanted to crush her chin.\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\nHe ignored her cries of pain.\n\n\"Set up? Lying on the same bed with him might be a set up, but what about the child in your belly?\"\n\n\"Sydney, I wanted so badly for that baby to be mine at that time... But all the hospitals we went to in Quill City showed the same result: You were fifteen days conceived a baby.!\n\n\"I was on a business trip for two months and you were fifteen days conceived a baby. How could you make me believe that nothing happened between you and him?!\"\n\nAfter that, Lorenzo shook her off.\n\nSydney fell on the pillow. She straightened her messy hair, stood up again and explained shakily, \"But the first doctor I consulted was a traditional medicine practitioner. The old doctor said that I was two months conceived a baby. I didn't tell you immediately because I wanted to wait for you to come back to give you a surprise!\n\n\"You\u2019ve met that old doctor too. He showed you the prescription he gave me with the time written on it. Why won't you...\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Lorenzo interrupted her, \"Handwritten time has no credibility, and it's easier to bribe an old traditional medicine practitioner. Stop now and shut up!\"\n\nShe stood in his shoes and could understand the hurt in his heart. However, she still felt heartbroken from how he decisively shunned her.\n\nEspecially their child. The rejection was heartbreakingly painful.\n\nShe knew it was useless to say anything, so she kept quiet and shed tears of frustration.\n\nLorenzo got out of bed and made a phone call.\n\nThe room was quiet. As the call connected, Sydney heard the voice on the other end. She quickly got out of bed.\n\nA woman\u2019s voice. \"Mr. Bailey\u2026\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"Are you still here?\"\n\nWoman, \"Yes, do you want to come over?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lorenzo said and hung up the phone. \n\nSydney held him back. Her eyes widened with tears and her voice trembled. \"Are you seeing someone else?\"\n\nChapter 0002\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\nSydney\u2019s world collapsed as she burst into tears. \"When did it happen?! Who is she?!\"\n\nShe looked utterly miserable now. Lorenzo had no mercy, he might have even felt a little pleasure seeing her in pain.\n\n\"Can\u2019t stand seeing me with someone else?\"\n\nYes, she could not stand it.\n\nLoving a person would inherently make one possessive. Lorenzo meant so much to her that she could not accept losing him.\n\nAt this moment, the way she was just speechlessly hyperventilating due to the blow was more pathetic than crying. It felt like she was falling to pieces.\n\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He got dressed and left the bedroom.\n\nSydney refused to give up and chased after him. \"Why won\u2019t you believe that I was set up?\"\n\nLorenzo stopped and turned around. \"Then tell me, who set you up?\"\n\nThe corridor of the mansion was wide and long. Sydney was speechless as she looked at the lanky man in white shirt and trousers.    \n\nFour years ago, they talked about this many times. Each time they got stuck here.\n\nExactly.\n\nShe still did not find out who did it.\n\nThe setup was extremely vicious.\n\nLorenzo and Sydney\u2019s relationship turned from true love to pure hatred. They were so miserable for each other that it broke apart Lorenzo and Oliver\u2019s friendship. It also caused Sydney to become mentally ill, miscarrying from extreme heartache...\n\nHowever, she still could not identify the mastermind behind this! Four years ago, Sydney and Oliver searched for a long time but to no avail.\n\nLorenzo left.\n\nSydney stood in the corridor for a long time. She clutched her chest and raced towards the room at the corner of the corridor, calling out with each step, \"Mrs. Harper...\"\n\nHer breath became shorter each time.\n\nWhen she reached the door, she reached out and knocked, then her vision went dark as she fell to the ground unconscious.\n\nThe door opened shortly. The nanny had the shock of her life and quickly picked Sydney up in panic. \"Madam!\"\n\nThe sound of a car driving away was heard downstairs.\n\nSydney regained consciousness after Mrs. Harper gave her first aid.\n\nMrs. Harper had a glass of water and a handful of white pills in her hand. She said, \"Madam, why don't you tell your husband about your condition? If he sympathizes with you because of this, you might...\"\n\nSydney shook her head stubbornly, \"He and I are together because we love each other. I don't want to be pitied.\"\n\nShe took the pills and swallowed them. She closed her eyes and kept silent for a long time, then she said to Mrs. Harper, \"He\u2019s seeing someone else. I want to know who she is. Tell me, is it okay for me to ask his friends?\"\n\n\u2026\n\nMelon, the largest nightclub in Quill City.\n\nMusic was blaring in a VIP room. Lorenzo kicked the door open and went in. The men who were dancing intimately with the women almost soiled their pants.\n\nHowever, no one dared to be angry.\n\nLorenzo was a peculiar legend in Quill City. In his youth, he was an uncivilized and rebellious devil. Despite being a member of the Bailey Group, the wealthiest corporation in Quill City, he was cast out as the black sheep of the family and was dead broke.\n\nLater, his parents could not stand it anymore and made a plan for him to study abroad. He refused without hesitation. Instead, he relied on the prize money he got from a gaming tournament and simply enrolled himself in a vocational school.\n\nSuch a self-destructive person suddenly changed at the age of twenty.\n\nLorenzo became extremely hard-working. He diligently went to class and hung out in the library. He would also dress up and leave the dormitory at around six o'clock every morning. He rode the bicycle for an hour to Quill City Fine Arts Academy for lectures.\n\nSome people claimed that he had fallen in love with a student from Quill City Fine Arts Academy.\n\nNot long after, he wanted to start a company. His family was not supportive, of course. So, he put a knife to Grandpa Bailey\u2019s throat and grabbed 300 million to open a jewelry company, registered as Cherr.y.\n\nAt that time, the Baileys thought that the 300 million was burned for good. However, Cherr.y turned out to be unexpectedly successful. It made ten times the profit in its second year. In the fourth year, it was listed in Newford.\n\nToday, the \u2018Black Sheep\u2019 was a self-made man and had become the heir to the Bailey Group. Cherr.y had become a world-renowned jewelry brand.\n\nAs soon as Lorenzo sat down on the sofa, a group of beauties quickly came over and said, \"Mr. Bailey!\"\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nThe women trembled in fright and scurried away. Two more men sat down and said, \"Lorenzo, what pissed you off at home?\"\n\nLorenzo kept quiet. He picked up a glass and started chugging.\n\nThe others did not say anything anymore. They picked up their glass to drink with him.\n\nNot a moment later, someone's cell phone rang on the table.\n\n\"Xavier, your phone!\"\n\nA handsome man with platinum blond hair sat up on the sofa in a dark hidden corner.\n\nXavier woke up from his nap and scratched his tattooed neck. He took a look at his cell phone and his eyes widened.\n\n\"Lorenzo,\" he looked at Lorenzo, \"Why is Sydney calling me?\"\n\nLorenzo paused mid-drink and looked at Xavier. \"Who?\"\n\nXavier walked up to him with his cell phone, \"Your wife!\"\n\nLorenzo's expression turned sinister. \"When did you get her number?\"\n\nXavier said casually, \"On the day you both got married, I gave her my number when we sang together in the karaoke bar.\"\n\nHearing that, Lorenzo stood up abruptly and grabbed Xavier's collar, \"Who asked you to give your number?\"\n\nXavier frowned, puzzled at his friend\u2019s sudden rage. He pushed Lorenzo's hand away, \"We were all having fun, what\u2019s the big deal in exchanging contact information?\"\n\nLorenzo got angry. \"WHY\"\n\nWith that, he punched the undefended Xavier.\n\nXavier was caught off guard and slammed onto the marble table. The wine and glasses on the table clattered onto the floor.\n\nThe atmosphere froze. Lorenzo's eyes turned red like a furious beast. He growled, \"Delete her number!\"\n\nXavier was no sitting duck either. He was the second generation of the Altmans, an old money family in Quill City.  He was the prodigal son of the Altmans, a notorious troublemaker. He could hang out frequently with Lorenzo because they were similar.\n\nXavier wiped the bleeding corner of his lips and punched Lorenzo in return. \"What's going on, Popeye? Use your words, not your fists!\"\n\nLorenzo was hit on the head. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then he grabbed Xavier, pressed him on the sofa and beat him in a frenzy. \"How many times have you contacted Sydney in the past two years?!!\"\n\nXavier dodged Lorenzo's heavy punches and said, \"Why would I contact your wife like I have nothing else to do?! Have you gone mad? I'll admit you to the mental hospital!\"\n\nThese words seemed to hit a nerve. Lorenzo paused. \n\nHe was stunned for a few seconds. Then, he sat down on the side and then closed his eyes to quell the anger in his heart.\n\nXavier sat up, frowned and rubbed his shoulders. Vulgarities spewed.\n\nLorenzo ignored Xavier. After a while, he calmed down. He opened his eagle eyes and scanned the other men in the room, \"Who else saved her number?\"\n\nImmediately, several men lowered their heads to look for their phones.\n\nLorenzo was startled.\n\nImmediately, terrifying sounds of broken bottles filled the space, as well as Lorenzo's angry swear words, and screams of women as they dodge shards of glass.\n\nLorenzo seemed to have lost his mind and started attacking all his friends.\n\nXavier stepped outside with his cell phone and returned Sydney\u2019s call.\n\nWhen Sydney picked up, Xavier humbly said, \"Hi, Sydney. What's the matter?\"\n\nSydney's voice was gentle and polite. \"Xavier, I'm sorry to bother you. Lorenzo got a little upset with me tonight. He blocked me and I can't contact him. I wanted to ask if you know where he is.\"\n\nChapter 0003\n\"He was drinking with me, and now he's drunk and acting crazy. I'll send him back to you later. Don\u2019t worry.\"\n\nSydney paused for a moment then said, \"Can you give me the address? I want to check on him myself.\"\n\nXavier took a deep breath, opened the door and saw the chaos inside. He said, \"Melon, A.\"\n\nAbout ten minutes later, apart from Lorenzo and Xavier, everyone else left.\n\nLorenzo sat on the sofa. He stared at the chandelier on the ceiling, lost in thoughts.\n\nXavier sat next to him, \"We are not a part of your drama with Sydney. If anything, go home and solve it with her. Don't go crazy here.\"\n\nLorenzo closed his eyes. \"I\u2019m not going home.\"\n\n\"You must,\" \"Then tell me what happened between you two, I\u2019ll find a way for you.\"\n\nLorenzo, \"You can't.\"\n\n\u201cFine,\" Xavier said, \"If you won't go home, where will you go later?\"\n\n\"Chelsea will pick me up.\"\n\nXavier was stunned for a moment. \"Are you okay? You got so anxious when your wife called me. And now you\u2019re going to see another woman?\n\n\"I met you late. I don't know what happened between you and Sydney. You left her alone for two years, acting like you really don't care. However, we are not allowed to keep her contact information. What on earth are you thinking?\"\n\nLorenzo became impatient again. \"Boy, don\u2019t meddle with adult matters.\"\n\nWhen Xavier started to curse, a creaking sound came from the door. The two of them looked towards the door.\n\n\u201cEnzo,\u201d A sweet voice came.\n\nThe woman had the body of a devil and the face of an angel as she slithered in. She was the \u2018Nation\u2019s Goddess\u2019 and top tier actress, Chelsea Dune.\n \nLorenzo's expression finally softened a little when she appeared. \"Here she comes.\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows subtly.\n\nChelsea elegantly sat next to Lorenzo while avoiding the mess on the ground. She saw the cut at the corner of his eye.\n\nThe woman frowned. \"Why are you hurt?\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"It's nothing. I just drank too much.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt?\" As she spoke, Chelsea reached out and took Lorenzo's arm.\n\nXavier said with a smile, \"Hey Superstar, do you know he is married?\"\n\nChelsea paused and retracted her hand in embarrassment. \"Enzo and I are just friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, cool.\"\n\nLorenzo seemed displeased with Xavier's sarcasm towards Chelsea. He retorted, \"What are you trying to say?\"\n\nXavier stuck his tongue in his cheek and stood up with a grin. \"Nothing. Things among you guys are too complicated for my little brain. I\u2019m gonna go home to bed.\"\n\nAs soon as Xavier reached the door, the door was opened from the outside.\n\nXavier paused.\n\nSydney stood timidly at the door.\n\nShe was timid but she was objectively eye-catching.\n\nHer long, dark and wavy hair draped casually down her back. She had light makeup on her delicate and pretty face. Her lips were as bright as cherry, with a hint of sparkle.\n\nThe velvet, burgundy strappy dress contrasted with her flawless, snow-white skin. She was like a blooming red rose in the dark night.\n\nXavier gulped. He forgot how to speak at that moment.\n\nLorenzo's voice was suddenly heard. \"Who\u2019s there?\"\n\nXavier was stunned,and stepped aside to make way for Sydney. After Sydney entered the room, he exhaled and came back to his senses.\n\nAs soon as Sydney reached the door, she froze.\n\nEveryone had left. The private room had the brightest lights turned on. Right in the middle, Lorenzo and Chelsea were sitting together with their arms touching each other. To Sydney, that scene hurt her eyes more than the light.\n\nHer breath was stuck in her throat. Her lips quivered, but she could not say a word.\n\nLorenzo had an affair with Chelsea, her college bully!\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Lorenzo frowned, \"Go back!\"\n\nSydney shuddered then finally took a step. She quickened her pace.\n\nShe went up to the two of them. While everyone was caught off guard, she slapped Chelsea across the face and grabbed her hair. \"It's you!\"\n\nChelsea screamed, \"Ah! Enzo, help me!\"\n\n\u201cSydney!\u201d\n\nWhen Lorenzo spoke, Sydney let go of Chelsea. She raised her hand towards Lorenzo, but did not strike him.\n\nHer hands trembled. She broke down and shouted, \"You clearly know what she did to me back then! Of all the people, why her?!\"\n\nSuddenly.\n\nSlap!\n\nChelsea took advantage when Sydney was unguarded and slapped her back. That slap was even harder than Sydney\u2019s.\n\nSydney felt ringing in her ears, and then blood dripped from the corners of her lips.\n\nChelsea snarled, \"Why blame others if you can't keep your man?!\"\n\nSydney held her face. Her eyes turned red at Chelsea\u2019s smug expression. She shouted, \"I'm taking your life. \n\nShe tried to attack Chelsea again, but Lorenzo stopped her. He grabbed the back of her head and threw her to the other side of the sofa.\n\n\"I told you to go back, are you deaf?\"\n\nSydney felt as if she had gone deaf. The ringing in her ears was so severe that she couldn't hear what Lorenzo said. Half of her head was throbbing.\n\nAt this moment, Chelsea suddenly covered her ears and wailed, \"Enzo, I can't hear!\"\n\nLorenzo was shocked, \"You can\u2019t hear?\"\n\nChelsea's eyes widened in pity, and her cries became louder. \"I can't hear what you said...\"\n\nLorenzo looked back and glared at Sydney fiercely. He stood up, arms over Chelsea and walked out, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier, saw Lorenzo escorting a tearful Chelsea out of the room. He knew something was amiss and quickly entered the room.\n\nSydney closed her eyes and clasped her head with her hands. She fell sideways on the sofa. Her shoulders shook.\n\nAt the moment, half of that bright and charming face was as pale as paper, and the other half was marked with an angry palm print. The blood on the corners of her lips stood out even more.\n\nXavier's eyes widened and he rushed over. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney did not respond.\n\nXavier nudged her gently. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney then opened her eyes, her voice fading away, \"My, my ears hurt...\"\n\nWith the slap mark and her ear hurting, Xavier immediately understood what had happened. He helped Sydney up and said, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\nSydney only managed to take two steps before her legs gave way. She was about to crash.\n\nPeople lose strength when they cannot bear the pain. Sydney would rather die than have Lorenzo cheated on her with Chelsea.\n\nXavier felt a pang of distress. He carried Sydney in his arms and hurried out.\n\n\u2026\n\nLorenzo and Chelsea stopped outside the main entrance of Melon. He said, \"Wait for me here, I'll get the car.\"\n\nChelsea held him and said, \"Enzo, I'm better now. I don\u2019t think I need to go to the hospital. Come with me and stay with me, okay?\"\n\nLorenzo frowned, and just as he was about to agree, something behind Chelsea attracted his attention.\n\nXavier carried Sydney and walked quickly towards the parking lot.\n\nLorenzo frowned, \"Since you don't need to go to the hospital, you should go back to the hotel first.\"\n\nWith that, he turned to chase after Xavier, but Chelsea pulled him back. \"Are you going to look for Sydney? How could she treat you like that but you still can't let her go?\"\n\nChapter 0004\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He did not answer and strode after Xavier.\n\nChelsea exhaled forcefully. Her shoulders trembled. She looked at Sydney and Xavier with clear hatred and jealousy.\n\nHowever, Lorenzo did not manage to intercept Xavier. When he passed by, Xavier's car drifted gorgeously before merging onto the main freeway.\n\n\u2026\n\nInside the car.\n\nSydney crumpled into a ball and leaned against the car window. Xavier fastened the seat belt for her.\n\nTears streamed down her face the whole time, but she was expressionless, like a soulless sculpture.\n\nThe pain in her ear strained the nerves across her head, and pulled out many memories that she did not want to recall.\n\nA group of heavily made-up girls surrounded her. The proudest one leading the pack, was Chelsea, the one with the harmless face.\n\nHer smile was pure evil. She pulled Sydney\u2019s hair, and let her companions take turns to slap her. Chelsea dripped melted white ice cream on Sydney\u2019s face and chest.\n\nSydney dared not resist because her grandmother, Mary Collins, was in the hands of Christopher, Chelsea's father.\n\nThe Dunes were quite wealthy. Christopher owned a ceramics company, and Mary used to work as a cleaner in Christopher\u2019s office building.\n\nMary had always done a good job, but that day Chelsea insisted that Mary accidentally destroyed her father's documents. Even a fool knew that it was all a farce.\n\nSydney was a freshman that year and Chelsea was a sophomore.\n\nAt the Quill City Fine Arts Academy, Chelsea had always been the most sought-after goddess by many in the school. After Sydney entered the school, she stole Chelsea\u2019s glory.\n\nJealousy was written all over Chelsea's innocent face.\n\nChelsea took those humiliating photos and made Sydney look cheap. Soon, other people's harsh words tormented her as well.\n\nSydney, you are so pretty. If You planned turns a resentful woman,would your grandma still need to be a cleaner in her old age to support the family?\n\n\"Sydney! Hey, Sydney!\"\n\nXavier's words pulled her back from her thoughts.\n\nShe turned her head blankly to be met with a pair of gentle, concerned eyes.\n\nXavier saw her motionless and thought she had died with her eyes wide open.\n\nThe speed of the car was fast, and the pressure on her back felt comfortable. Sydney took the pills earlier and felt better because her discomfort was suppressed. Her ears still hurt but she could hear clearly.\n\n\"Xavier, thank you.\"\n\nXavier breathed out, \"As long as you're fine.\"\n\nSydney continued to be silent.\n\nIt was already four o'clock in the middle of the night. There were very few cars on the road.\n\nAfter Xavier turned a corner, he looked back at her.\n\nHis Adam's apple rolled quietly once more.\n\nSydney looked bright and charming from the front, but she looked even more striking with her smooth facial outline and high nose from the side. Her thick eyelashes were naturally curled; It felt like she was God\u2019s favorite.\n\nSydney stood out even among beauties and was considered stunning. She was spotted by a talent scout when she hit puberty in her first year of high school.\n\nHowever, her mother refused to allow her to enter the entertainment industry, so she had been keeping her head down at school. Initially, her mother had strict requirements. Sydney was not allowed to have long hair or wear nice clothes.\n\nThroughout high school, she had ugly short hair and wore puffy, outdated and tacky clothes. She was bullied when she started dressing up in college. It was not until she fell in love with that Black Sheep Enzo that she began to step out of her shell because she had someone to protect her.\n\nXavier broke the silence in the car again. \"You knew that all the boys have only known Lorenzo in the past three or four years. Am I right to say that you and Lorenzo have known each other for a long time?\"\n\nWith that, Sydney said, \"Yeah, he was my first love. I dated him when I was a freshman. He stayed with me throughout my college days for four years. We broke up when I graduated...\"\n\n\"After two years of separation, the elders in our respective families crossed paths by accident, and they arranged for us to get married for some reason. I was willing to get married, but he was not.\"\n\nXavier frowned. \"Do you...love him very much?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Sydney\u2019s voice trembled again, \"He used to be... very good to me. Extremely good.\"\n\nShe was deeply caught up by their love, whereby a simple sentence could dig up those heavy and profound memories.\n\n\"I don't have a father. Lorenzo not only gave me the sense of security that a boyfriend should, but he was protective like a father.\n\n\"For every holiday, others are picked up by their parents, but Lorenzo picked me up. At every start of the school season, parents would send their kids to class, but Lorenzo would send me. The day before school started, he would help me check my luggage. He would make sure I had everything I needed. He would also secretly put money into the pockets of my clothes.\u201d\n\nSydney's tears rolled down her cheeks again as she recalled those memories.\n\nXavier tightened his grip on the steering wheel. His expression became heavy. He did not expect Lorenzo to have such a tender and considerate side.\n\nHowever, tenderness and consideration were the most fearful things in a relationship because trying to move on after a breakup was tantamount to chipping away at the bones.\n\nAfter a moment, Xavier spoke, \"You are now... relying on his past kindness to you to support your marriage.\"\n\nThis sentence summed up her lonely married life for the past two years. Sydney lifted her hand and wiped her eyes, \"I am not willing to lose him. We were so good together; I really can't accept the current situation...\"\n   \n\nXavier said, \"But Sydney, have you ever thought about it? Many couples who have been estranged were once deeply in love in the past. You\u2019ve been tormenting yourself by living in the past. You will definitely meet a man who treats you better in the future.\"\n\nSydney sobbed, \"I tried moving on, but I still can't get over...\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows and changed his approach. \"Chelsea hit you, but he took Chelsea away without concern for you. Can you bear it?\"\n\nSydney was stunned for a moment. The hidden deep affection in her eyes was immediately replaced by hatred as her emotions flared up.\n\n\"No, I told Lorenzo from the start that anyone who is friends with Chelsea is my enemy. Did Lorenzo really have feelings for Chelsea, or did he do it deliberately to spite me...\n\n\"No, I can't think like that either,\" she began to mumble through her chaotic thoughts, \"No matter what his purpose is, if he really slept with Chelsea...\"\n\nShe did not continue, but closed her eyes and began to take deep breaths.\n\nSome scenes were just fantasies, but enough to suffocate her.\n\nXavier's heart ached a little when he saw Sydney in pain. At the same time, he was also curious about what happened between Sydney and Chelsea.\n\nJust as he was about to ask, his cell phone, which he had thrown inside the armrest storage, rang.\n\nHe looked down. It was a call from Lorenzo.\n\nXavier frowned, turned over his phone and clicked to hang up. He glanced in the rearview mirror again.\n\nBehind him was a flashy, black and red car, the world\u2019s rarest supercar. A toy owned by the richest man in Quill City.\n\nXavier looked at Sydney again. Her sobs could really melt a man's heart. He secretly gripped the steering wheel.\n\nIt was not Sydney who gave him her number first. The men, including him, noticed Lorenzo's indifference towards her, but were too captivated by her beauty, so they asked for it behind Lorenzo's back.\n\nOf course, they all found a perfect reason. They asked Sydney to leave her number, so they could contact her for business purposes.\n\nAt that time, no one dared to have filthy intentions. She was Lorenzo's legal wife, and Lorenzo was one of the most outstanding people among his friends.\n\nAside from the fact that Sydney was married, she was indeed a rare beauty. Everyone thought it was harmless to keep a beautiful woman\u2019s phone number.\n\nHowever, things were different now.\n\nHe swerved the steering wheel abruptly and turned around in the opposite direction. He accelerated to 200 miles an hour, and threw Lorenzo off his trail.\n\nChapter 0005\nXavier was driving dangerously fast, but his expression was exceptionally calm.\n\nIn addition to running several companies, he was also a part-time F2 racing driver.\n\nFor Lorenzo, the supercar was just a means of transportation, but in Xavier's hands, it was a toy. He was sure that Lorenzo would not be able to catch up.\n\nLorenzo watched Xavier's car zoom by his car like a ghost. He was stunned for a moment and quickly turned around. Two minutes later, he lost them.\n\nHe continued to call Xavier while flooring the accelerator, but still no one answered.\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier knew that he had other intentions when he ditched Lorenzo, but he dared not show it in front of Sydney right away.\n\nAfter all, she was still Lorenzo's wife. Xavier was one year younger than Lorenzo whom he regarded as his blood brother, so she was his sister-in-law, in a sense.\n\nHe took her to the hospital as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter the medical check-up to make sure there were no major problems, Xavier took Sydney back to Celestial Park after applying ice patches to her face.\n\nCelestial Park was a famous luxury residential area in Quill City. Sydney and Lorenzo bought their marital home here.\n\nAs soon as Sydney got to the bedroom, she saw Lorenzo sitting on the sofa at the end of the bed. There was a bottle of white wine on the round table next to him.\n\nSydney's eyes flashed. Without saying a word, she went to bed, lay down, and closed her eyes.\n\nA few seconds later, the man's footsteps were heard.\n\nSydney shivered. Her eyelashes became wet again.\n\nLorenzo suddenly got on the bed and pressed on her. She opened her eyes and started to push him away. \"Don't touch me...\"\n\nLorenzo paused, grabbed her collar with both hands, and tore her skirt apart.\n\nSydney's eyes widened with shock. Her screams echoed through the bedroom. \"Don't touch me with the hand you used to touch Chelsea Dune!\"\n\nLorenzo froze.\n\nSydney looked at him as tears poured down her face. \"I can have no dignity in front of you because we were dependent on each other for those four years. You provided a great deal for me, and you are also the closest person to me besides my mother and grandmother. My heart breaks for you because you were hurt by what happened back then. I can\u2019t bear to see you in deep pain every day because of me so I allow you to vent your grievances by hurting me!\n\n\u201cBut I can't share the same man with Chelsea, and I can't have the hand that touched her, touch me!!\n\n\u201cShe is the last straw of my dignity, Lorenzo!\"\n\nHowever, these words did not move Lorenzo to show any guilt.\n\nInstead, he became angrier. \"What about my last straw?\"\n\n\"I was disgusted by you too after Oliver touched you. What you do that night when we got registered?\"\n  \nSydney trembled. She choked.\n\nThat night.\n  \nHer mother and mother-in-law both wanted to seize the opportunity so that she and Lorenzo could have a child as soon as possible, so they tampered with their tea.\n\nLorenzo thought it was Sydney who Framed him.\n\n\"Why aren't you talking?\" Lorenzo's eyes were red as he stared into hers, \"Where did Xavier take you? He deliberately didn't answer my call. What did you do?\"\n\n\"Can you stop being suspicious of everyone and anyone? He took me to the hospital!\"\n\n\"Hospital?\" Lorenzo sneered, and he tightened his grip on her clothes, this time tearing her skirt all the way, \"Sydney, lift your legs for me!\"\n\nSydney panicked. \"What are you going to do?!\"\n\n\"Let's see if you betrayed me again!\"\n\nSydney immediately closed her knees together, \"I didn't!\"\n\nLorenzo pressed harder and his voice became more forceful, \"I don't believe a word you said!\"\n\nSuch stubborn words made Sydney lose the will to refute him.\n\nShe looked at Lorenzo\u2019s frightening and gloomy face and felt disgusted with him for the first time.\n\nShe reached out and pinched the back of his hand. \"Let me go, I'm tired, I want to sleep!\"\n\n\"I don't want to sleep, why should you sleep!\" Lorenzo was still furious. He did not seem to feel any pain in the back of his hand. The grip in his hand became stronger and stronger.\n\nHe pulled apart Sydney's knees quickly. He spread her legs apart so hard that even her behinds hurt.\n\nHe was worried that she would resist, so he pressed his knee on her belly and untied his belt.\n\nSydney's tears rolled to the side of her temples and wet the pillow. Still, she said nothing. Since pinching the back of his hand did not work, she pinched his neck hard.\n\nLorenzo winced in pain, but still did not let her go.\n\nIt felt as if he would not give up if he did not test her.\n\nLorenzo's neck,and even his arms and abdominal muscles were left bruised from Sydney's pinching while she gradually lost hope.\n\nShe wilted like dry roses, losing all trace of vitality.\n\nLorenzo endured the pain and tried to control her, but failed.\n\nSydney's tearful eyes trembled. Her hand squeezing his chest loosened, and she finally spoke again, \"Is that enough?\"\n\n\"Enough?\" Unexpectedly, Lorenzo felt even more enraged. He reached out and yanked open the drawer on the bedside table, took out the bottle of essential oil she bought, and then slammed the drawer shut!\n\nSydney seized this opportunity and tried to escape, but he grabbed her ankle in time. \"Be good!\"\n\nSydney stopped resisting. She knew she would not be able to escape tonight.\n\nShe was in tears, but she laughed. \"Lorenzo, I really didn't expect that one day I would be disgusted with you. Go ahead, disgust me more. So I can hate you enough, and give you what you want...\"\n\nShe thought, \u2018Lorenzo should know what I was referring to.\u2019\n\nIn the split second, her refusal to sign the divorce agreement suddenly wavered.\n\nDuring the time between being taken away by Xavier and being sent back home, she had been recalling the past.\n\nWhen she recalled the past with Chelsea, she did not want to lose her self-esteem. However, when she recalled every moment with Lorenzo, she did not want to regret losing the man she loved most.\n\nShe was deeply confused by these opposing feelings.\n\nHowever, right now, she actually felt disgusted with the man she loved most.\n\nShe was glad.\n\nDisgusted by him meant that she could finally let him go one day. \n\nLorenzo's face darkened at Sydney\u2019s words. He could not tell whether he was angry or something else.\n\nShe wanted to say more, but Lorenzo's lips suddenly covered hers.\n\nAt the same time, his fingertips of both hands trailed up along her waistline.\n\nThe faint smell of tobacco mixed with the fragrance and wine was an alluring masculine aroma. In the past, she could never resist his kisses.\n\nLorenzo was even wilder in the past than he is now. He was like a lion in the savanna. The passion and impulse he made her feel was strong and without restraint.\n\nApart from the four years they were separated, they had slept together for four years until now. He understood every part of her body, her preferred tension and pressure.\n\nSoon, her body reacted uncontrollably."

                      "text": "Chapter 0001\nIt was ten o'clock in the evening. Sydney Castro sat in front of the dressing table, rubbing essential oils on her body for that glowing skin.\n\nClearly, she was getting ready to please a man.\n\nHer husband, whom she had not seen for two years, was returning to Somerland today. She missed him terribly.\n\nSydney oiled every part of her body until she was soft and smooth. Then she put on a white, furry lingerie set with a cheeky little cat tail on the small of her back.\n\nIn truth, she did not have to go to such trouble in the past. Lorenzo had wished he could stick to her every day, but after that fateful day, everything changed.\n\nShe went from being his closest lover to the woman he hated the most.\n\nLater, their elders arranged for them to get married. However, Lorenzo was so reluctant that he left the country the day after signing their marriage certificate.\n\nNow two years have passed, during which he only contacted her once. It was six months after her mother's death that he sent her a divorce agreement.\n\nSydney did not sign the papers. She still harbored thoughts of rekindling her marriage with Lorenzo.\n\nHowever, it was difficult.\n\nShe was not even aware he was returning tonight. She only found out when she saw Lorenzo\u2019s friends posted about their drinking session on social media.\n\nLater, she called her mother-in-law, who helped her and sent a driver to bring Lorenzo back.\n\nThe driver called. Lorenzo would be home in a few minutes.\n\nShe had to seize this opportunity and try to rekindle their old flame again.\n\nIntentionally dressed up, she knelt on fours by the bed, evenly distributing the rose petals that had been sprinkled on the bed in advance. She was so engrossed that she did not notice a long shadow walking in.\n\nSuddenly, Sydney\u2019s cat tail was yanked hard as a hot-blooded torso pressed on her back. Her heart skipped a beat. She turned back and came face-to-face with a deep yet intense set of piercing eyes.\n\n\"Enzo...\" she began delicately, \"You finally came...\" Back.\n\nThe rest of her sentence was choked back by a kiss reeking of ethanol.\n\nSydney's eyelashes fluttered as her body responded to his. She was not sure whether Lorenzo was drunk or if her outfit tonight was a success. \n\nLorenzo kissed her so passionately that he wanted to suck her lips swollen. He placed his hands over her waist , grabbing them vigorously.\n\nThe man seemed satisfied. While taking a breath, he growled in a whisper. \"good...\"\n\nGrowling in a whisper was considered flirting. That was Lorenzo\u2019s special habit. \n\nRecently, she had been doing yoga. Her figure was way better than two years ago. This was also a surprise for Lorenzo. His words and actions ignited the fire in her heart.\n\nHer plump waist rose and fell violently. Her rapid breath escaped her rosy lips. Her glowy, fair hands explored his waist through his custom silk shirt, caressing his hard and steamy muscles for the first time in a long time. She hurriedly unbuttoned his shirt.\n\nThe smooth material slid down his strong arms. She unbuckled his belt and wrapped her legs around his waist.\n\nEight years of familiarity with each other made them very compatible in bed. No need for any fluff, they went straight into it.\n\nPerhaps it was because they had not seen each other for too long. His desire seemed to be even more intense than hers, just like when he first tasted the forbidden fruit eight years ago. The man was excited and tireless.\n\nThis went on for more than three hours. Finally, he was satisfied.\n\nSydney laid on the man's beautiful sculpted chest and kissed his handsome face obsessively, trying to make up for lost time.\n\nLorenzo kept his eyes closed, allowing her kisses.\n\n \"I'm very pleased with you tonight.\"Lorenzo said\n\nSydney smiled and kissed the corner of his lips again.\n\nLorenzo raised the corners of his lips. He grabbed her waist hard, and turned over to hold her down.\n\nSydney was sure that he was in a good mood now.\n\nShe stretched out her hand to rub his Adam's apple. Right before they did it again, she said bluntly, \"Enzo, four years ago\u2026I swear nothing happened between Oliver and I. My body and soul completely belong to you. You are finally back. Can we please forget what happened that day and move forward together?\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the smile on the man's face froze instantly.\n\nLorenzo raised his hand and grabbed Sydney\u2019s throat. \n\nSydney's heart skipped a beat. She widened her eyes in panic. It was over. She had said the wrong thing.\n\nThis happened twice before. If she mentioned the words \"four years ago\", Lorenzo would immediately become ruthless and sinister.\n\nHer best friend once said that Lorenzo's reaction was akin to PTSD, a post-traumatic stress reaction.\n\nShe had doubts at the time, and it turned out to be the same today, which proved that her best friend was right.\n\nIn a daze, she heard Lorenzo say, \"Move forward with me? You?\n\n\"I touched you tonight because I'm afraid that you,  wouldn\u2019t change your disgusting habit and sleep with my friends again!\"\n\n\"I won't, I didn\u2019t...\" Sydney explained and reached out to touch his hand, attempting to soothe him.\n\nLorenzo's hand tightened, \"Don't touch me!\"\n\nSydney's face was red from Lorenzo\u2019s grip on her throat.\n\nLorenzo took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. \"You'd better sign the divorce agreement as soon as possible. The past love we had will never be rekindled.\"\n\n The words \u2018divorce agreement\u2019 stabbed Sydney\u2019s heart like a sword. She looked up anxiously, and said with difficulty, \"We were so good back then. Are you going to completely deny all that I\u2019ve done for you, just because of that incident?\n\n\"Oliver and I both explained back then that nothing happened to us. We were set up!\"\n\nHowever, the more she explained, the angrier Lorenzo became. His hand went up her neck and grabbed her chin. The force in his grip became stronger and stronger. Sydney could feel that he wanted to crush her chin.\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\nHe ignored her cries of pain.\n\n\"Set up? Lying on the same bed with him might be a set up, but what about the child in your belly?\"\n\n\"Sydney, I wanted so badly for that baby to be mine at that time... But all the hospitals we went to in Quill City showed the same result: You were fifteen days conceived a baby.!\n\n\"I was on a business trip for two months and you were fifteen days conceived a baby. How could you make me believe that nothing happened between you and him?!\"\n\nAfter that, Lorenzo shook her off.\n\nSydney fell on the pillow. She straightened her messy hair, stood up again and explained shakily, \"But the first doctor I consulted was a traditional medicine practitioner. The old doctor said that I was two months conceived a baby. I didn't tell you immediately because I wanted to wait for you to come back to give you a surprise!\n\n\"You\u2019ve met that old doctor too. He showed you the prescription he gave me with the time written on it. Why won't you...\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Lorenzo interrupted her, \"Handwritten time has no credibility, and it's easier to bribe an old traditional medicine practitioner. Stop now and shut up!\"\n\nShe stood in his shoes and could understand the hurt in his heart. However, she still felt heartbroken from how he decisively shunned her.\n\nEspecially their child. The rejection was heartbreakingly painful.\n\nShe knew it was useless to say anything, so she kept quiet and shed tears of frustration.\n\nLorenzo got out of bed and made a phone call.\n\nThe room was quiet. As the call connected, Sydney heard the voice on the other end. She quickly got out of bed.\n\nA woman\u2019s voice. \"Mr. Bailey\u2026\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"Are you still here?\"\n\nWoman, \"Yes, do you want to come over?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lorenzo said and hung up the phone. \n\nSydney held him back. Her eyes widened with tears and her voice trembled. \"Are you seeing someone else?\"\n\nChapter 0002\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\nSydney\u2019s world collapsed as she burst into tears. \"When did it happen?! Who is she?!\"\n\nShe looked utterly miserable now. Lorenzo had no mercy, he might have even felt a little pleasure seeing her in pain.\n\n\"Can\u2019t stand seeing me with someone else?\"\n\nYes, she could not stand it.\n\nLoving a person would inherently make one possessive. Lorenzo meant so much to her that she could not accept losing him.\n\nAt this moment, the way she was just speechlessly hyperventilating due to the blow was more pathetic than crying. It felt like she was falling to pieces.\n\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He got dressed and left the bedroom.\n\nSydney refused to give up and chased after him. \"Why won\u2019t you believe that I was set up?\"\n\nLorenzo stopped and turned around. \"Then tell me, who set you up?\"\n\nThe corridor of the mansion was wide and long. Sydney was speechless as she looked at the lanky man in white shirt and trousers.    \n\nFour years ago, they talked about this many times. Each time they got stuck here.\n\nExactly.\n\nShe still did not find out who did it.\n\nThe setup was extremely vicious.\n\nLorenzo and Sydney\u2019s relationship turned from true love to pure hatred. They were so miserable for each other that it broke apart Lorenzo and Oliver\u2019s friendship. It also caused Sydney to become mentally ill, miscarrying from extreme heartache...\n\nHowever, she still could not identify the mastermind behind this! Four years ago, Sydney and Oliver searched for a long time but to no avail.\n\nLorenzo left.\n\nSydney stood in the corridor for a long time. She clutched her chest and raced towards the room at the corner of the corridor, calling out with each step, \"Mrs. Harper...\"\n\nHer breath became shorter each time.\n\nWhen she reached the door, she reached out and knocked, then her vision went dark as she fell to the ground unconscious.\n\nThe door opened shortly. The nanny had the shock of her life and quickly picked Sydney up in panic. \"Madam!\"\n\nThe sound of a car driving away was heard downstairs.\n\nSydney regained consciousness after Mrs. Harper gave her first aid.\n\nMrs. Harper had a glass of water and a handful of white pills in her hand. She said, \"Madam, why don't you tell your husband about your condition? If he sympathizes with you because of this, you might...\"\n\nSydney shook her head stubbornly, \"He and I are together because we love each other. I don't want to be pitied.\"\n\nShe took the pills and swallowed them. She closed her eyes and kept silent for a long time, then she said to Mrs. Harper, \"He\u2019s seeing someone else. I want to know who she is. Tell me, is it okay for me to ask his friends?\"\n\n\u2026\n\nMelon, the largest nightclub in Quill City.\n\nMusic was blaring in a VIP room. Lorenzo kicked the door open and went in. The men who were dancing intimately with the women almost soiled their pants.\n\nHowever, no one dared to be angry.\n\nLorenzo was a peculiar legend in Quill City. In his youth, he was an uncivilized and rebellious devil. Despite being a member of the Bailey Group, the wealthiest corporation in Quill City, he was cast out as the black sheep of the family and was dead broke.\n\nLater, his parents could not stand it anymore and made a plan for him to study abroad. He refused without hesitation. Instead, he relied on the prize money he got from a gaming tournament and simply enrolled himself in a vocational school.\n\nSuch a self-destructive person suddenly changed at the age of twenty.\n\nLorenzo became extremely hard-working. He diligently went to class and hung out in the library. He would also dress up and leave the dormitory at around six o'clock every morning. He rode the bicycle for an hour to Quill City Fine Arts Academy for lectures.\n\nSome people claimed that he had fallen in love with a student from Quill City Fine Arts Academy.\n\nNot long after, he wanted to start a company. His family was not supportive, of course. So, he put a knife to Grandpa Bailey\u2019s throat and grabbed 300 million to open a jewelry company, registered as Cherr.y.\n\nAt that time, the Baileys thought that the 300 million was burned for good. However, Cherr.y turned out to be unexpectedly successful. It made ten times the profit in its second year. In the fourth year, it was listed in Newford.\n\nToday, the \u2018Black Sheep\u2019 was a self-made man and had become the heir to the Bailey Group. Cherr.y had become a world-renowned jewelry brand.\n\nAs soon as Lorenzo sat down on the sofa, a group of beauties quickly came over and said, \"Mr. Bailey!\"\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nThe women trembled in fright and scurried away. Two more men sat down and said, \"Lorenzo, what pissed you off at home?\"\n\nLorenzo kept quiet. He picked up a glass and started chugging.\n\nThe others did not say anything anymore. They picked up their glass to drink with him.\n\nNot a moment later, someone's cell phone rang on the table.\n\n\"Xavier, your phone!\"\n\nA handsome man with platinum blond hair sat up on the sofa in a dark hidden corner.\n\nXavier woke up from his nap and scratched his tattooed neck. He took a look at his cell phone and his eyes widened.\n\n\"Lorenzo,\" he looked at Lorenzo, \"Why is Sydney calling me?\"\n\nLorenzo paused mid-drink and looked at Xavier. \"Who?\"\n\nXavier walked up to him with his cell phone, \"Your wife!\"\n\nLorenzo's expression turned sinister. \"When did you get her number?\"\n\nXavier said casually, \"On the day you both got married, I gave her my number when we sang together in the karaoke bar.\"\n\nHearing that, Lorenzo stood up abruptly and grabbed Xavier's collar, \"Who asked you to give your number?\"\n\nXavier frowned, puzzled at his friend\u2019s sudden rage. He pushed Lorenzo's hand away, \"We were all having fun, what\u2019s the big deal in exchanging contact information?\"\n\nLorenzo got angry. \"WHY\"\n\nWith that, he punched the undefended Xavier.\n\nXavier was caught off guard and slammed onto the marble table. The wine and glasses on the table clattered onto the floor.\n\nThe atmosphere froze. Lorenzo's eyes turned red like a furious beast. He growled, \"Delete her number!\"\n\nXavier was no sitting duck either. He was the second generation of the Altmans, an old money family in Quill City.  He was the prodigal son of the Altmans, a notorious troublemaker. He could hang out frequently with Lorenzo because they were similar.\n\nXavier wiped the bleeding corner of his lips and punched Lorenzo in return. \"What's going on, Popeye? Use your words, not your fists!\"\n\nLorenzo was hit on the head. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then he grabbed Xavier, pressed him on the sofa and beat him in a frenzy. \"How many times have you contacted Sydney in the past two years?!!\"\n\nXavier dodged Lorenzo's heavy punches and said, \"Why would I contact your wife like I have nothing else to do?! Have you gone mad? I'll admit you to the mental hospital!\"\n\nThese words seemed to hit a nerve. Lorenzo paused. \n\nHe was stunned for a few seconds. Then, he sat down on the side and then closed his eyes to quell the anger in his heart.\n\nXavier sat up, frowned and rubbed his shoulders. Vulgarities spewed.\n\nLorenzo ignored Xavier. After a while, he calmed down. He opened his eagle eyes and scanned the other men in the room, \"Who else saved her number?\"\n\nImmediately, several men lowered their heads to look for their phones.\n\nLorenzo was startled.\n\nImmediately, terrifying sounds of broken bottles filled the space, as well as Lorenzo's angry swear words, and screams of women as they dodge shards of glass.\n\nLorenzo seemed to have lost his mind and started attacking all his friends.\n\nXavier stepped outside with his cell phone and returned Sydney\u2019s call.\n\nWhen Sydney picked up, Xavier humbly said, \"Hi, Sydney. What's the matter?\"\n\nSydney's voice was gentle and polite. \"Xavier, I'm sorry to bother you. Lorenzo got a little upset with me tonight. He blocked me and I can't contact him. I wanted to ask if you know where he is.\"\n\nChapter 0003\n\"He was drinking with me, and now he's drunk and acting crazy. I'll send him back to you later. Don\u2019t worry.\"\n\nSydney paused for a moment then said, \"Can you give me the address? I want to check on him myself.\"\n\nXavier took a deep breath, opened the door and saw the chaos inside. He said, \"Melon, A.\"\n\nAbout ten minutes later, apart from Lorenzo and Xavier, everyone else left.\n\nLorenzo sat on the sofa. He stared at the chandelier on the ceiling, lost in thoughts.\n\nXavier sat next to him, \"We are not a part of your drama with Sydney. If anything, go home and solve it with her. Don't go crazy here.\"\n\nLorenzo closed his eyes. \"I\u2019m not going home.\"\n\n\"You must,\" \"Then tell me what happened between you two, I\u2019ll find a way for you.\"\n\nLorenzo, \"You can't.\"\n\n\u201cFine,\" Xavier said, \"If you won't go home, where will you go later?\"\n\n\"Chelsea will pick me up.\"\n\nXavier was stunned for a moment. \"Are you okay? You got so anxious when your wife called me. And now you\u2019re going to see another woman?\n\n\"I met you late. I don't know what happened between you and Sydney. You left her alone for two years, acting like you really don't care. However, we are not allowed to keep her contact information. What on earth are you thinking?\"\n\nLorenzo became impatient again. \"Boy, don\u2019t meddle with adult matters.\"\n\nWhen Xavier started to curse, a creaking sound came from the door. The two of them looked towards the door.\n\n\u201cEnzo,\u201d A sweet voice came.\n\nThe woman had the body of a devil and the face of an angel as she slithered in. She was the \u2018Nation\u2019s Goddess\u2019 and top tier actress, Chelsea Dune.\n \nLorenzo's expression finally softened a little when she appeared. \"Here she comes.\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows subtly.\n\nChelsea elegantly sat next to Lorenzo while avoiding the mess on the ground. She saw the cut at the corner of his eye.\n\nThe woman frowned. \"Why are you hurt?\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"It's nothing. I just drank too much.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt?\" As she spoke, Chelsea reached out and took Lorenzo's arm.\n\nXavier said with a smile, \"Hey Superstar, do you know he is married?\"\n\nChelsea paused and retracted her hand in embarrassment. \"Enzo and I are just friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, cool.\"\n\nLorenzo seemed displeased with Xavier's sarcasm towards Chelsea. He retorted, \"What are you trying to say?\"\n\nXavier stuck his tongue in his cheek and stood up with a grin. \"Nothing. Things among you guys are too complicated for my little brain. I\u2019m gonna go home to bed.\"\n\nAs soon as Xavier reached the door, the door was opened from the outside.\n\nXavier paused.\n\nSydney stood timidly at the door.\n\nShe was timid but she was objectively eye-catching.\n\nHer long, dark and wavy hair draped casually down her back. She had light makeup on her delicate and pretty face. Her lips were as bright as cherry, with a hint of sparkle.\n\nThe velvet, burgundy strappy dress contrasted with her flawless, snow-white skin. She was like a blooming red rose in the dark night.\n\nXavier gulped. He forgot how to speak at that moment.\n\nLorenzo's voice was suddenly heard. \"Who\u2019s there?\"\n\nXavier was stunned,and stepped aside to make way for Sydney. After Sydney entered the room, he exhaled and came back to his senses.\n\nAs soon as Sydney reached the door, she froze.\n\nEveryone had left. The private room had the brightest lights turned on. Right in the middle, Lorenzo and Chelsea were sitting together with their arms touching each other. To Sydney, that scene hurt her eyes more than the light.\n\nHer breath was stuck in her throat. Her lips quivered, but she could not say a word.\n\nLorenzo had an affair with Chelsea, her college bully!\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Lorenzo frowned, \"Go back!\"\n\nSydney shuddered then finally took a step. She quickened her pace.\n\nShe went up to the two of them. While everyone was caught off guard, she slapped Chelsea across the face and grabbed her hair. \"It's you!\"\n\nChelsea screamed, \"Ah! Enzo, help me!\"\n\n\u201cSydney!\u201d\n\nWhen Lorenzo spoke, Sydney let go of Chelsea. She raised her hand towards Lorenzo, but did not strike him.\n\nHer hands trembled. She broke down and shouted, \"You clearly know what she did to me back then! Of all the people, why her?!\"\n\nSuddenly.\n\nSlap!\n\nChelsea took advantage when Sydney was unguarded and slapped her back. That slap was even harder than Sydney\u2019s.\n\nSydney felt ringing in her ears, and then blood dripped from the corners of her lips.\n\nChelsea snarled, \"Why blame others if you can't keep your man?!\"\n\nSydney held her face. Her eyes turned red at Chelsea\u2019s smug expression. She shouted, \"I'm taking your life. \n\nShe tried to attack Chelsea again, but Lorenzo stopped her. He grabbed the back of her head and threw her to the other side of the sofa.\n\n\"I told you to go back, are you deaf?\"\n\nSydney felt as if she had gone deaf. The ringing in her ears was so severe that she couldn't hear what Lorenzo said. Half of her head was throbbing.\n\nAt this moment, Chelsea suddenly covered her ears and wailed, \"Enzo, I can't hear!\"\n\nLorenzo was shocked, \"You can\u2019t hear?\"\n\nChelsea's eyes widened in pity, and her cries became louder. \"I can't hear what you said...\"\n\nLorenzo looked back and glared at Sydney fiercely. He stood up, arms over Chelsea and walked out, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier, saw Lorenzo escorting a tearful Chelsea out of the room. He knew something was amiss and quickly entered the room.\n\nSydney closed her eyes and clasped her head with her hands. She fell sideways on the sofa. Her shoulders shook.\n\nAt the moment, half of that bright and charming face was as pale as paper, and the other half was marked with an angry palm print. The blood on the corners of her lips stood out even more.\n\nXavier's eyes widened and he rushed over. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney did not respond.\n\nXavier nudged her gently. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney then opened her eyes, her voice fading away, \"My, my ears hurt...\"\n\nWith the slap mark and her ear hurting, Xavier immediately understood what had happened. He helped Sydney up and said, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\nSydney only managed to take two steps before her legs gave way. She was about to crash.\n\nPeople lose strength when they cannot bear the pain. Sydney would rather die than have Lorenzo cheated on her with Chelsea.\n\nXavier felt a pang of distress. He carried Sydney in his arms and hurried out.\n\n\u2026\n\nLorenzo and Chelsea stopped outside the main entrance of Melon. He said, \"Wait for me here, I'll get the car.\"\n\nChelsea held him and said, \"Enzo, I'm better now. I don\u2019t think I need to go to the hospital. Come with me and stay with me, okay?\"\n\nLorenzo frowned, and just as he was about to agree, something behind Chelsea attracted his attention.\n\nXavier carried Sydney and walked quickly towards the parking lot.\n\nLorenzo frowned, \"Since you don't need to go to the hospital, you should go back to the hotel first.\"\n\nWith that, he turned to chase after Xavier, but Chelsea pulled him back. \"Are you going to look for Sydney? How could she treat you like that but you still can't let her go?\"\n\nChapter 0004\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He did not answer and strode after Xavier.\n\nChelsea exhaled forcefully. Her shoulders trembled. She looked at Sydney and Xavier with clear hatred and jealousy.\n\nHowever, Lorenzo did not manage to intercept Xavier. When he passed by, Xavier's car drifted gorgeously before merging onto the main freeway.\n\n\u2026\n\nInside the car.\n\nSydney crumpled into a ball and leaned against the car window. Xavier fastened the seat belt for her.\n\nTears streamed down her face the whole time, but she was expressionless, like a soulless sculpture.\n\nThe pain in her ear strained the nerves across her head, and pulled out many memories that she did not want to recall.\n\nA group of heavily made-up girls surrounded her. The proudest one leading the pack, was Chelsea, the one with the harmless face.\n\nHer smile was pure evil. She pulled Sydney\u2019s hair, and let her companions take turns to slap her. Chelsea dripped melted white ice cream on Sydney\u2019s face and chest.\n\nSydney dared not resist because her grandmother, Mary Collins, was in the hands of Christopher, Chelsea's father.\n\nThe Dunes were quite wealthy. Christopher owned a ceramics company, and Mary used to work as a cleaner in Christopher\u2019s office building.\n\nMary had always done a good job, but that day Chelsea insisted that Mary accidentally destroyed her father's documents. Even a fool knew that it was all a farce.\n\nSydney was a freshman that year and Chelsea was a sophomore.\n\nAt the Quill City Fine Arts Academy, Chelsea had always been the most sought-after goddess by many in the school. After Sydney entered the school, she stole Chelsea\u2019s glory.\n\nJealousy was written all over Chelsea's innocent face.\n\nChelsea took those humiliating photos and made Sydney look cheap. Soon, other people's harsh words tormented her as well.\n\nSydney, you are so pretty. If You planned turns a resentful woman,would your grandma still need to be a cleaner in her old age to support the family?\n\n\"Sydney! Hey, Sydney!\"\n\nXavier's words pulled her back from her thoughts.\n\nShe turned her head blankly to be met with a pair of gentle, concerned eyes.\n\nXavier saw her motionless and thought she had died with her eyes wide open.\n\nThe speed of the car was fast, and the pressure on her back felt comfortable. Sydney took the pills earlier and felt better because her discomfort was suppressed. Her ears still hurt but she could hear clearly.\n\n\"Xavier, thank you.\"\n\nXavier breathed out, \"As long as you're fine.\"\n\nSydney continued to be silent.\n\nIt was already four o'clock in the middle of the night. There were very few cars on the road.\n\nAfter Xavier turned a corner, he looked back at her.\n\nHis Adam's apple rolled quietly once more.\n\nSydney looked bright and charming from the front, but she looked even more striking with her smooth facial outline and high nose from the side. Her thick eyelashes were naturally curled; It felt like she was God\u2019s favorite.\n\nSydney stood out even among beauties and was considered stunning. She was spotted by a talent scout when she hit puberty in her first year of high school.\n\nHowever, her mother refused to allow her to enter the entertainment industry, so she had been keeping her head down at school. Initially, her mother had strict requirements. Sydney was not allowed to have long hair or wear nice clothes.\n\nThroughout high school, she had ugly short hair and wore puffy, outdated and tacky clothes. She was bullied when she started dressing up in college. It was not until she fell in love with that Black Sheep Enzo that she began to step out of her shell because she had someone to protect her.\n\nXavier broke the silence in the car again. \"You knew that all the boys have only known Lorenzo in the past three or four years. Am I right to say that you and Lorenzo have known each other for a long time?\"\n\nWith that, Sydney said, \"Yeah, he was my first love. I dated him when I was a freshman. He stayed with me throughout my college days for four years. We broke up when I graduated...\"\n\n\"After two years of separation, the elders in our respective families crossed paths by accident, and they arranged for us to get married for some reason. I was willing to get married, but he was not.\"\n\nXavier frowned. \"Do you...love him very much?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Sydney\u2019s voice trembled again, \"He used to be... very good to me. Extremely good.\"\n\nShe was deeply caught up by their love, whereby a simple sentence could dig up those heavy and profound memories.\n\n\"I don't have a father. Lorenzo not only gave me the sense of security that a boyfriend should, but he was protective like a father.\n\n\"For every holiday, others are picked up by their parents, but Lorenzo picked me up. At every start of the school season, parents would send their kids to class, but Lorenzo would send me. The day before school started, he would help me check my luggage. He would make sure I had everything I needed. He would also secretly put money into the pockets of my clothes.\u201d\n\nSydney's tears rolled down her cheeks again as she recalled those memories.\n\nXavier tightened his grip on the steering wheel. His expression became heavy. He did not expect Lorenzo to have such a tender and considerate side.\n\nHowever, tenderness and consideration were the most fearful things in a relationship because trying to move on after a breakup was tantamount to chipping away at the bones.\n\nAfter a moment, Xavier spoke, \"You are now... relying on his past kindness to you to support your marriage.\"\n\nThis sentence summed up her lonely married life for the past two years. Sydney lifted her hand and wiped her eyes, \"I am not willing to lose him. We were so good together; I really can't accept the current situation...\"\n   \n\nXavier said, \"But Sydney, have you ever thought about it? Many couples who have been estranged were once deeply in love in the past. You\u2019ve been tormenting yourself by living in the past. You will definitely meet a man who treats you better in the future.\"\n\nSydney sobbed, \"I tried moving on, but I still can't get over...\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows and changed his approach. \"Chelsea hit you, but he took Chelsea away without concern for you. Can you bear it?\"\n\nSydney was stunned for a moment. The hidden deep affection in her eyes was immediately replaced by hatred as her emotions flared up.\n\n\"No, I told Lorenzo from the start that anyone who is friends with Chelsea is my enemy. Did Lorenzo really have feelings for Chelsea, or did he do it deliberately to spite me...\n\n\"No, I can't think like that either,\" she began to mumble through her chaotic thoughts, \"No matter what his purpose is, if he really slept with Chelsea...\"\n\nShe did not continue, but closed her eyes and began to take deep breaths.\n\nSome scenes were just fantasies, but enough to suffocate her.\n\nXavier's heart ached a little when he saw Sydney in pain. At the same time, he was also curious about what happened between Sydney and Chelsea.\n\nJust as he was about to ask, his cell phone, which he had thrown inside the armrest storage, rang.\n\nHe looked down. It was a call from Lorenzo.\n\nXavier frowned, turned over his phone and clicked to hang up. He glanced in the rearview mirror again.\n\nBehind him was a flashy, black and red car, the world\u2019s rarest supercar. A toy owned by the richest man in Quill City.\n\nXavier looked at Sydney again. Her sobs could really melt a man's heart. He secretly gripped the steering wheel.\n\nIt was not Sydney who gave him her number first. The men, including him, noticed Lorenzo's indifference towards her, but were too captivated by her beauty, so they asked for it behind Lorenzo's back.\n\nOf course, they all found a perfect reason. They asked Sydney to leave her number, so they could contact her for business purposes.\n\nAt that time, no one dared to have filthy intentions. She was Lorenzo's legal wife, and Lorenzo was one of the most outstanding people among his friends.\n\nAside from the fact that Sydney was married, she was indeed a rare beauty. Everyone thought it was harmless to keep a beautiful woman\u2019s phone number.\n\nHowever, things were different now.\n\nHe swerved the steering wheel abruptly and turned around in the opposite direction. He accelerated to 200 miles an hour, and threw Lorenzo off his trail.\n\nChapter 0005\nXavier was driving dangerously fast, but his expression was exceptionally calm.\n\nIn addition to running several companies, he was also a part-time F2 racing driver.\n\nFor Lorenzo, the supercar was just a means of transportation, but in Xavier's hands, it was a toy. He was sure that Lorenzo would not be able to catch up.\n\nLorenzo watched Xavier's car zoom by his car like a ghost. He was stunned for a moment and quickly turned around. Two minutes later, he lost them.\n\nHe continued to call Xavier while flooring the accelerator, but still no one answered.\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier knew that he had other intentions when he ditched Lorenzo, but he dared not show it in front of Sydney right away.\n\nAfter all, she was still Lorenzo's wife. Xavier was one year younger than Lorenzo whom he regarded as his blood brother, so she was his sister-in-law, in a sense.\n\nHe took her to the hospital as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter the medical check-up to make sure there were no major problems, Xavier took Sydney back to Celestial Park after applying ice patches to her face.\n\nCelestial Park was a famous luxury residential area in Quill City. Sydney and Lorenzo bought their marital home here.\n\nAs soon as Sydney got to the bedroom, she saw Lorenzo sitting on the sofa at the end of the bed. There was a bottle of white wine on the round table next to him.\n\nSydney's eyes flashed. Without saying a word, she went to bed, lay down, and closed her eyes.\n\nA few seconds later, the man's footsteps were heard.\n\nSydney shivered. Her eyelashes became wet again.\n\nLorenzo suddenly got on the bed and pressed on her. She opened her eyes and started to push him away. \"Don't touch me...\"\n\nLorenzo paused, grabbed her collar with both hands, and tore her skirt apart.\n\nSydney's eyes widened with shock. Her screams echoed through the bedroom. \"Don't touch me with the hand you used to touch Chelsea Dune!\"\n\nLorenzo froze.\n\nSydney looked at him as tears poured down her face. \"I can have no dignity in front of you because we were dependent on each other for those four years. You provided a great deal for me, and you are also the closest person to me besides my mother and grandmother. My heart breaks for you because you were hurt by what happened back then. I can\u2019t bear to see you in deep pain every day because of me so I allow you to vent your grievances by hurting me!\n\n\u201cBut I can't share the same man with Chelsea, and I can't have the hand that touched her, touch me!!\n\n\u201cShe is the last straw of my dignity, Lorenzo!\"\n\nHowever, these words did not move Lorenzo to show any guilt.\n\nInstead, he became angrier. \"What about my last straw?\"\n\n\"I was disgusted by you too after Oliver touched you. What you do that night when we got registered?\"\n  \nSydney trembled. She choked.\n\nThat night.\n  \nHer mother and mother-in-law both wanted to seize the opportunity so that she and Lorenzo could have a child as soon as possible, so they tampered with their tea.\n\nLorenzo thought it was Sydney who Framed him.\n\n\"Why aren't you talking?\" Lorenzo's eyes were red as he stared into hers, \"Where did Xavier take you? He deliberately didn't answer my call. What did you do?\"\n\n\"Can you stop being suspicious of everyone and anyone? He took me to the hospital!\"\n\n\"Hospital?\" Lorenzo sneered, and he tightened his grip on her clothes, this time tearing her skirt all the way, \"Sydney, lift your legs for me!\"\n\nSydney panicked. \"What are you going to do?!\"\n\n\"Let's see if you betrayed me again!\"\n\nSydney immediately closed her knees together, \"I didn't!\"\n\nLorenzo pressed harder and his voice became more forceful, \"I don't believe a word you said!\"\n\nSuch stubborn words made Sydney lose the will to refute him.\n\nShe looked at Lorenzo\u2019s frightening and gloomy face and felt disgusted with him for the first time.\n\nShe reached out and pinched the back of his hand. \"Let me go, I'm tired, I want to sleep!\"\n\n\"I don't want to sleep, why should you sleep!\" Lorenzo was still furious. He did not seem to feel any pain in the back of his hand. The grip in his hand became stronger and stronger.\n\nHe pulled apart Sydney's knees quickly. He spread her legs apart so hard that even her behinds hurt.\n\nHe was worried that she would resist, so he pressed his knee on her belly and untied his belt.\n\nSydney's tears rolled to the side of her temples and wet the pillow. Still, she said nothing. Since pinching the back of his hand did not work, she pinched his neck hard.\n\nLorenzo winced in pain, but still did not let her go.\n\nIt felt as if he would not give up if he did not test her.\n\nLorenzo's neck,and even his arms and abdominal muscles were left bruised from Sydney's pinching while she gradually lost hope.\n\nShe wilted like dry roses, losing all trace of vitality.\n\nLorenzo endured the pain and tried to control her, but failed.\n\nSydney's tearful eyes trembled. Her hand squeezing his chest loosened, and she finally spoke again, \"Is that enough?\"\n\n\"Enough?\" Unexpectedly, Lorenzo felt even more enraged. He reached out and yanked open the drawer on the bedside table, took out the bottle of essential oil she bought, and then slammed the drawer shut!\n\nSydney seized this opportunity and tried to escape, but he grabbed her ankle in time. \"Be good!\"\n\nSydney stopped resisting. She knew she would not be able to escape tonight.\n\nShe was in tears, but she laughed. \"Lorenzo, I really didn't expect that one day I would be disgusted with you. Go ahead, disgust me more. So I can hate you enough, and give you what you want...\"\n\nShe thought, \u2018Lorenzo should know what I was referring to.\u2019\n\nIn the split second, her refusal to sign the divorce agreement suddenly wavered.\n\nDuring the time between being taken away by Xavier and being sent back home, she had been recalling the past.\n\nWhen she recalled the past with Chelsea, she did not want to lose her self-esteem. However, when she recalled every moment with Lorenzo, she did not want to regret losing the man she loved most.\n\nShe was deeply confused by these opposing feelings.\n\nHowever, right now, she actually felt disgusted with the man she loved most.\n\nShe was glad.\n\nDisgusted by him meant that she could finally let him go one day. \n\nLorenzo's face darkened at Sydney\u2019s words. He could not tell whether he was angry or something else.\n\nShe wanted to say more, but Lorenzo's lips suddenly covered hers.\n\nAt the same time, his fingertips of both hands trailed up along her waistline.\n\nThe faint smell of tobacco mixed with the fragrance and wine was an alluring masculine aroma. In the past, she could never resist his kisses.\n\nLorenzo was even wilder in the past than he is now. He was like a lion in the savanna. The passion and impulse he made her feel was strong and without restraint.\n\nApart from the four years they were separated, they had slept together for four years until now. He understood every part of her body, her preferred tension and pressure.\n\nSoon, her body reacted uncontrollably."

                      "text": "Chapter 0001\nIt was ten o'clock in the evening. Sydney Castro sat in front of the dressing table, rubbing essential oils on her body for that glowing skin.\n\nClearly, she was getting ready to please a man.\n\nHer husband, whom she had not seen for two years, was returning to Somerland today. She missed him terribly.\n\nSydney oiled every part of her body until she was soft and smooth. Then she put on a white, furry lingerie set with a cheeky little cat tail on the small of her back.\n\nIn truth, she did not have to go to such trouble in the past. Lorenzo had wished he could stick to her every day, but after that fateful day, everything changed.\n\nShe went from being his closest lover to the woman he hated the most.\n\nLater, their elders arranged for them to get married. However, Lorenzo was so reluctant that he left the country the day after signing their marriage certificate.\n\nNow two years have passed, during which he only contacted her once. It was six months after her mother's death that he sent her a divorce agreement.\n\nSydney did not sign the papers. She still harbored thoughts of rekindling her marriage with Lorenzo.\n\nHowever, it was difficult.\n\nShe was not even aware he was returning tonight. She only found out when she saw Lorenzo\u2019s friends posted about their drinking session on social media.\n\nLater, she called her mother-in-law, who helped her and sent a driver to bring Lorenzo back.\n\nThe driver called. Lorenzo would be home in a few minutes.\n\nShe had to seize this opportunity and try to rekindle their old flame again.\n\nIntentionally dressed up, she knelt on fours by the bed, evenly distributing the rose petals that had been sprinkled on the bed in advance. She was so engrossed that she did not notice a long shadow walking in.\n\nSuddenly, Sydney\u2019s cat tail was yanked hard as a hot-blooded torso pressed on her back. Her heart skipped a beat. She turned back and came face-to-face with a deep yet intense set of piercing eyes.\n\n\"Enzo...\" she began delicately, \"You finally came...\" Back.\n\nThe rest of her sentence was choked back by a kiss reeking of ethanol.\n\nSydney's eyelashes fluttered as her body responded to his. She was not sure whether Lorenzo was drunk or if her outfit tonight was a success. \n\nLorenzo kissed her so passionately that he wanted to suck her lips swollen. He placed his hands over her waist , grabbing them vigorously.\n\nThe man seemed satisfied. While taking a breath, he growled in a whisper. \"good...\"\n\nGrowling in a whisper was considered flirting. That was Lorenzo\u2019s special habit. \n\nRecently, she had been doing yoga. Her figure was way better than two years ago. This was also a surprise for Lorenzo. His words and actions ignited the fire in her heart.\n\nHer plump waist rose and fell violently. Her rapid breath escaped her rosy lips. Her glowy, fair hands explored his waist through his custom silk shirt, caressing his hard and steamy muscles for the first time in a long time. She hurriedly unbuttoned his shirt.\n\nThe smooth material slid down his strong arms. She unbuckled his belt and wrapped her legs around his waist.\n\nEight years of familiarity with each other made them very compatible in bed. No need for any fluff, they went straight into it.\n\nPerhaps it was because they had not seen each other for too long. His desire seemed to be even more intense than hers, just like when he first tasted the forbidden fruit eight years ago. The man was excited and tireless.\n\nThis went on for more than three hours. Finally, he was satisfied.\n\nSydney laid on the man's beautiful sculpted chest and kissed his handsome face obsessively, trying to make up for lost time.\n\nLorenzo kept his eyes closed, allowing her kisses.\n\n \"I'm very pleased with you tonight.\"Lorenzo said\n\nSydney smiled and kissed the corner of his lips again.\n\nLorenzo raised the corners of his lips. He grabbed her waist hard, and turned over to hold her down.\n\nSydney was sure that he was in a good mood now.\n\nShe stretched out her hand to rub his Adam's apple. Right before they did it again, she said bluntly, \"Enzo, four years ago\u2026I swear nothing happened between Oliver and I. My body and soul completely belong to you. You are finally back. Can we please forget what happened that day and move forward together?\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the smile on the man's face froze instantly.\n\nLorenzo raised his hand and grabbed Sydney\u2019s throat. \n\nSydney's heart skipped a beat. She widened her eyes in panic. It was over. She had said the wrong thing.\n\nThis happened twice before. If she mentioned the words \"four years ago\", Lorenzo would immediately become ruthless and sinister.\n\nHer best friend once said that Lorenzo's reaction was akin to PTSD, a post-traumatic stress reaction.\n\nShe had doubts at the time, and it turned out to be the same today, which proved that her best friend was right.\n\nIn a daze, she heard Lorenzo say, \"Move forward with me? You?\n\n\"I touched you tonight because I'm afraid that you,  wouldn\u2019t change your disgusting habit and sleep with my friends again!\"\n\n\"I won't, I didn\u2019t...\" Sydney explained and reached out to touch his hand, attempting to soothe him.\n\nLorenzo's hand tightened, \"Don't touch me!\"\n\nSydney's face was red from Lorenzo\u2019s grip on her throat.\n\nLorenzo took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. \"You'd better sign the divorce agreement as soon as possible. The past love we had will never be rekindled.\"\n\n The words \u2018divorce agreement\u2019 stabbed Sydney\u2019s heart like a sword. She looked up anxiously, and said with difficulty, \"We were so good back then. Are you going to completely deny all that I\u2019ve done for you, just because of that incident?\n\n\"Oliver and I both explained back then that nothing happened to us. We were set up!\"\n\nHowever, the more she explained, the angrier Lorenzo became. His hand went up her neck and grabbed her chin. The force in his grip became stronger and stronger. Sydney could feel that he wanted to crush her chin.\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\nHe ignored her cries of pain.\n\n\"Set up? Lying on the same bed with him might be a set up, but what about the child in your belly?\"\n\n\"Sydney, I wanted so badly for that baby to be mine at that time... But all the hospitals we went to in Quill City showed the same result: You were fifteen days conceived a baby.!\n\n\"I was on a business trip for two months and you were fifteen days conceived a baby. How could you make me believe that nothing happened between you and him?!\"\n\nAfter that, Lorenzo shook her off.\n\nSydney fell on the pillow. She straightened her messy hair, stood up again and explained shakily, \"But the first doctor I consulted was a traditional medicine practitioner. The old doctor said that I was two months conceived a baby. I didn't tell you immediately because I wanted to wait for you to come back to give you a surprise!\n\n\"You\u2019ve met that old doctor too. He showed you the prescription he gave me with the time written on it. Why won't you...\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Lorenzo interrupted her, \"Handwritten time has no credibility, and it's easier to bribe an old traditional medicine practitioner. Stop now and shut up!\"\n\nShe stood in his shoes and could understand the hurt in his heart. However, she still felt heartbroken from how he decisively shunned her.\n\nEspecially their child. The rejection was heartbreakingly painful.\n\nShe knew it was useless to say anything, so she kept quiet and shed tears of frustration.\n\nLorenzo got out of bed and made a phone call.\n\nThe room was quiet. As the call connected, Sydney heard the voice on the other end. She quickly got out of bed.\n\nA woman\u2019s voice. \"Mr. Bailey\u2026\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"Are you still here?\"\n\nWoman, \"Yes, do you want to come over?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lorenzo said and hung up the phone. \n\nSydney held him back. Her eyes widened with tears and her voice trembled. \"Are you seeing someone else?\"\n\nChapter 0002\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\nSydney\u2019s world collapsed as she burst into tears. \"When did it happen?! Who is she?!\"\n\nShe looked utterly miserable now. Lorenzo had no mercy, he might have even felt a little pleasure seeing her in pain.\n\n\"Can\u2019t stand seeing me with someone else?\"\n\nYes, she could not stand it.\n\nLoving a person would inherently make one possessive. Lorenzo meant so much to her that she could not accept losing him.\n\nAt this moment, the way she was just speechlessly hyperventilating due to the blow was more pathetic than crying. It felt like she was falling to pieces.\n\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He got dressed and left the bedroom.\n\nSydney refused to give up and chased after him. \"Why won\u2019t you believe that I was set up?\"\n\nLorenzo stopped and turned around. \"Then tell me, who set you up?\"\n\nThe corridor of the mansion was wide and long. Sydney was speechless as she looked at the lanky man in white shirt and trousers.    \n\nFour years ago, they talked about this many times. Each time they got stuck here.\n\nExactly.\n\nShe still did not find out who did it.\n\nThe setup was extremely vicious.\n\nLorenzo and Sydney\u2019s relationship turned from true love to pure hatred. They were so miserable for each other that it broke apart Lorenzo and Oliver\u2019s friendship. It also caused Sydney to become mentally ill, miscarrying from extreme heartache...\n\nHowever, she still could not identify the mastermind behind this! Four years ago, Sydney and Oliver searched for a long time but to no avail.\n\nLorenzo left.\n\nSydney stood in the corridor for a long time. She clutched her chest and raced towards the room at the corner of the corridor, calling out with each step, \"Mrs. Harper...\"\n\nHer breath became shorter each time.\n\nWhen she reached the door, she reached out and knocked, then her vision went dark as she fell to the ground unconscious.\n\nThe door opened shortly. The nanny had the shock of her life and quickly picked Sydney up in panic. \"Madam!\"\n\nThe sound of a car driving away was heard downstairs.\n\nSydney regained consciousness after Mrs. Harper gave her first aid.\n\nMrs. Harper had a glass of water and a handful of white pills in her hand. She said, \"Madam, why don't you tell your husband about your condition? If he sympathizes with you because of this, you might...\"\n\nSydney shook her head stubbornly, \"He and I are together because we love each other. I don't want to be pitied.\"\n\nShe took the pills and swallowed them. She closed her eyes and kept silent for a long time, then she said to Mrs. Harper, \"He\u2019s seeing someone else. I want to know who she is. Tell me, is it okay for me to ask his friends?\"\n\n\u2026\n\nMelon, the largest nightclub in Quill City.\n\nMusic was blaring in a VIP room. Lorenzo kicked the door open and went in. The men who were dancing intimately with the women almost soiled their pants.\n\nHowever, no one dared to be angry.\n\nLorenzo was a peculiar legend in Quill City. In his youth, he was an uncivilized and rebellious devil. Despite being a member of the Bailey Group, the wealthiest corporation in Quill City, he was cast out as the black sheep of the family and was dead broke.\n\nLater, his parents could not stand it anymore and made a plan for him to study abroad. He refused without hesitation. Instead, he relied on the prize money he got from a gaming tournament and simply enrolled himself in a vocational school.\n\nSuch a self-destructive person suddenly changed at the age of twenty.\n\nLorenzo became extremely hard-working. He diligently went to class and hung out in the library. He would also dress up and leave the dormitory at around six o'clock every morning. He rode the bicycle for an hour to Quill City Fine Arts Academy for lectures.\n\nSome people claimed that he had fallen in love with a student from Quill City Fine Arts Academy.\n\nNot long after, he wanted to start a company. His family was not supportive, of course. So, he put a knife to Grandpa Bailey\u2019s throat and grabbed 300 million to open a jewelry company, registered as Cherr.y.\n\nAt that time, the Baileys thought that the 300 million was burned for good. However, Cherr.y turned out to be unexpectedly successful. It made ten times the profit in its second year. In the fourth year, it was listed in Newford.\n\nToday, the \u2018Black Sheep\u2019 was a self-made man and had become the heir to the Bailey Group. Cherr.y had become a world-renowned jewelry brand.\n\nAs soon as Lorenzo sat down on the sofa, a group of beauties quickly came over and said, \"Mr. Bailey!\"\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nThe women trembled in fright and scurried away. Two more men sat down and said, \"Lorenzo, what pissed you off at home?\"\n\nLorenzo kept quiet. He picked up a glass and started chugging.\n\nThe others did not say anything anymore. They picked up their glass to drink with him.\n\nNot a moment later, someone's cell phone rang on the table.\n\n\"Xavier, your phone!\"\n\nA handsome man with platinum blond hair sat up on the sofa in a dark hidden corner.\n\nXavier woke up from his nap and scratched his tattooed neck. He took a look at his cell phone and his eyes widened.\n\n\"Lorenzo,\" he looked at Lorenzo, \"Why is Sydney calling me?\"\n\nLorenzo paused mid-drink and looked at Xavier. \"Who?\"\n\nXavier walked up to him with his cell phone, \"Your wife!\"\n\nLorenzo's expression turned sinister. \"When did you get her number?\"\n\nXavier said casually, \"On the day you both got married, I gave her my number when we sang together in the karaoke bar.\"\n\nHearing that, Lorenzo stood up abruptly and grabbed Xavier's collar, \"Who asked you to give your number?\"\n\nXavier frowned, puzzled at his friend\u2019s sudden rage. He pushed Lorenzo's hand away, \"We were all having fun, what\u2019s the big deal in exchanging contact information?\"\n\nLorenzo got angry. \"WHY\"\n\nWith that, he punched the undefended Xavier.\n\nXavier was caught off guard and slammed onto the marble table. The wine and glasses on the table clattered onto the floor.\n\nThe atmosphere froze. Lorenzo's eyes turned red like a furious beast. He growled, \"Delete her number!\"\n\nXavier was no sitting duck either. He was the second generation of the Altmans, an old money family in Quill City.  He was the prodigal son of the Altmans, a notorious troublemaker. He could hang out frequently with Lorenzo because they were similar.\n\nXavier wiped the bleeding corner of his lips and punched Lorenzo in return. \"What's going on, Popeye? Use your words, not your fists!\"\n\nLorenzo was hit on the head. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then he grabbed Xavier, pressed him on the sofa and beat him in a frenzy. \"How many times have you contacted Sydney in the past two years?!!\"\n\nXavier dodged Lorenzo's heavy punches and said, \"Why would I contact your wife like I have nothing else to do?! Have you gone mad? I'll admit you to the mental hospital!\"\n\nThese words seemed to hit a nerve. Lorenzo paused. \n\nHe was stunned for a few seconds. Then, he sat down on the side and then closed his eyes to quell the anger in his heart.\n\nXavier sat up, frowned and rubbed his shoulders. Vulgarities spewed.\n\nLorenzo ignored Xavier. After a while, he calmed down. He opened his eagle eyes and scanned the other men in the room, \"Who else saved her number?\"\n\nImmediately, several men lowered their heads to look for their phones.\n\nLorenzo was startled.\n\nImmediately, terrifying sounds of broken bottles filled the space, as well as Lorenzo's angry swear words, and screams of women as they dodge shards of glass.\n\nLorenzo seemed to have lost his mind and started attacking all his friends.\n\nXavier stepped outside with his cell phone and returned Sydney\u2019s call.\n\nWhen Sydney picked up, Xavier humbly said, \"Hi, Sydney. What's the matter?\"\n\nSydney's voice was gentle and polite. \"Xavier, I'm sorry to bother you. Lorenzo got a little upset with me tonight. He blocked me and I can't contact him. I wanted to ask if you know where he is.\"\n\nChapter 0003\n\"He was drinking with me, and now he's drunk and acting crazy. I'll send him back to you later. Don\u2019t worry.\"\n\nSydney paused for a moment then said, \"Can you give me the address? I want to check on him myself.\"\n\nXavier took a deep breath, opened the door and saw the chaos inside. He said, \"Melon, A.\"\n\nAbout ten minutes later, apart from Lorenzo and Xavier, everyone else left.\n\nLorenzo sat on the sofa. He stared at the chandelier on the ceiling, lost in thoughts.\n\nXavier sat next to him, \"We are not a part of your drama with Sydney. If anything, go home and solve it with her. Don't go crazy here.\"\n\nLorenzo closed his eyes. \"I\u2019m not going home.\"\n\n\"You must,\" \"Then tell me what happened between you two, I\u2019ll find a way for you.\"\n\nLorenzo, \"You can't.\"\n\n\u201cFine,\" Xavier said, \"If you won't go home, where will you go later?\"\n\n\"Chelsea will pick me up.\"\n\nXavier was stunned for a moment. \"Are you okay? You got so anxious when your wife called me. And now you\u2019re going to see another woman?\n\n\"I met you late. I don't know what happened between you and Sydney. You left her alone for two years, acting like you really don't care. However, we are not allowed to keep her contact information. What on earth are you thinking?\"\n\nLorenzo became impatient again. \"Boy, don\u2019t meddle with adult matters.\"\n\nWhen Xavier started to curse, a creaking sound came from the door. The two of them looked towards the door.\n\n\u201cEnzo,\u201d A sweet voice came.\n\nThe woman had the body of a devil and the face of an angel as she slithered in. She was the \u2018Nation\u2019s Goddess\u2019 and top tier actress, Chelsea Dune.\n \nLorenzo's expression finally softened a little when she appeared. \"Here she comes.\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows subtly.\n\nChelsea elegantly sat next to Lorenzo while avoiding the mess on the ground. She saw the cut at the corner of his eye.\n\nThe woman frowned. \"Why are you hurt?\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"It's nothing. I just drank too much.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt?\" As she spoke, Chelsea reached out and took Lorenzo's arm.\n\nXavier said with a smile, \"Hey Superstar, do you know he is married?\"\n\nChelsea paused and retracted her hand in embarrassment. \"Enzo and I are just friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, cool.\"\n\nLorenzo seemed displeased with Xavier's sarcasm towards Chelsea. He retorted, \"What are you trying to say?\"\n\nXavier stuck his tongue in his cheek and stood up with a grin. \"Nothing. Things among you guys are too complicated for my little brain. I\u2019m gonna go home to bed.\"\n\nAs soon as Xavier reached the door, the door was opened from the outside.\n\nXavier paused.\n\nSydney stood timidly at the door.\n\nShe was timid but she was objectively eye-catching.\n\nHer long, dark and wavy hair draped casually down her back. She had light makeup on her delicate and pretty face. Her lips were as bright as cherry, with a hint of sparkle.\n\nThe velvet, burgundy strappy dress contrasted with her flawless, snow-white skin. She was like a blooming red rose in the dark night.\n\nXavier gulped. He forgot how to speak at that moment.\n\nLorenzo's voice was suddenly heard. \"Who\u2019s there?\"\n\nXavier was stunned,and stepped aside to make way for Sydney. After Sydney entered the room, he exhaled and came back to his senses.\n\nAs soon as Sydney reached the door, she froze.\n\nEveryone had left. The private room had the brightest lights turned on. Right in the middle, Lorenzo and Chelsea were sitting together with their arms touching each other. To Sydney, that scene hurt her eyes more than the light.\n\nHer breath was stuck in her throat. Her lips quivered, but she could not say a word.\n\nLorenzo had an affair with Chelsea, her college bully!\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Lorenzo frowned, \"Go back!\"\n\nSydney shuddered then finally took a step. She quickened her pace.\n\nShe went up to the two of them. While everyone was caught off guard, she slapped Chelsea across the face and grabbed her hair. \"It's you!\"\n\nChelsea screamed, \"Ah! Enzo, help me!\"\n\n\u201cSydney!\u201d\n\nWhen Lorenzo spoke, Sydney let go of Chelsea. She raised her hand towards Lorenzo, but did not strike him.\n\nHer hands trembled. She broke down and shouted, \"You clearly know what she did to me back then! Of all the people, why her?!\"\n\nSuddenly.\n\nSlap!\n\nChelsea took advantage when Sydney was unguarded and slapped her back. That slap was even harder than Sydney\u2019s.\n\nSydney felt ringing in her ears, and then blood dripped from the corners of her lips.\n\nChelsea snarled, \"Why blame others if you can't keep your man?!\"\n\nSydney held her face. Her eyes turned red at Chelsea\u2019s smug expression. She shouted, \"I'm taking your life. \n\nShe tried to attack Chelsea again, but Lorenzo stopped her. He grabbed the back of her head and threw her to the other side of the sofa.\n\n\"I told you to go back, are you deaf?\"\n\nSydney felt as if she had gone deaf. The ringing in her ears was so severe that she couldn't hear what Lorenzo said. Half of her head was throbbing.\n\nAt this moment, Chelsea suddenly covered her ears and wailed, \"Enzo, I can't hear!\"\n\nLorenzo was shocked, \"You can\u2019t hear?\"\n\nChelsea's eyes widened in pity, and her cries became louder. \"I can't hear what you said...\"\n\nLorenzo looked back and glared at Sydney fiercely. He stood up, arms over Chelsea and walked out, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier, saw Lorenzo escorting a tearful Chelsea out of the room. He knew something was amiss and quickly entered the room.\n\nSydney closed her eyes and clasped her head with her hands. She fell sideways on the sofa. Her shoulders shook.\n\nAt the moment, half of that bright and charming face was as pale as paper, and the other half was marked with an angry palm print. The blood on the corners of her lips stood out even more.\n\nXavier's eyes widened and he rushed over. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney did not respond.\n\nXavier nudged her gently. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney then opened her eyes, her voice fading away, \"My, my ears hurt...\"\n\nWith the slap mark and her ear hurting, Xavier immediately understood what had happened. He helped Sydney up and said, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\nSydney only managed to take two steps before her legs gave way. She was about to crash.\n\nPeople lose strength when they cannot bear the pain. Sydney would rather die than have Lorenzo cheated on her with Chelsea.\n\nXavier felt a pang of distress. He carried Sydney in his arms and hurried out.\n\n\u2026\n\nLorenzo and Chelsea stopped outside the main entrance of Melon. He said, \"Wait for me here, I'll get the car.\"\n\nChelsea held him and said, \"Enzo, I'm better now. I don\u2019t think I need to go to the hospital. Come with me and stay with me, okay?\"\n\nLorenzo frowned, and just as he was about to agree, something behind Chelsea attracted his attention.\n\nXavier carried Sydney and walked quickly towards the parking lot.\n\nLorenzo frowned, \"Since you don't need to go to the hospital, you should go back to the hotel first.\"\n\nWith that, he turned to chase after Xavier, but Chelsea pulled him back. \"Are you going to look for Sydney? How could she treat you like that but you still can't let her go?\"\n\nChapter 0004\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He did not answer and strode after Xavier.\n\nChelsea exhaled forcefully. Her shoulders trembled. She looked at Sydney and Xavier with clear hatred and jealousy.\n\nHowever, Lorenzo did not manage to intercept Xavier. When he passed by, Xavier's car drifted gorgeously before merging onto the main freeway.\n\n\u2026\n\nInside the car.\n\nSydney crumpled into a ball and leaned against the car window. Xavier fastened the seat belt for her.\n\nTears streamed down her face the whole time, but she was expressionless, like a soulless sculpture.\n\nThe pain in her ear strained the nerves across her head, and pulled out many memories that she did not want to recall.\n\nA group of heavily made-up girls surrounded her. The proudest one leading the pack, was Chelsea, the one with the harmless face.\n\nHer smile was pure evil. She pulled Sydney\u2019s hair, and let her companions take turns to slap her. Chelsea dripped melted white ice cream on Sydney\u2019s face and chest.\n\nSydney dared not resist because her grandmother, Mary Collins, was in the hands of Christopher, Chelsea's father.\n\nThe Dunes were quite wealthy. Christopher owned a ceramics company, and Mary used to work as a cleaner in Christopher\u2019s office building.\n\nMary had always done a good job, but that day Chelsea insisted that Mary accidentally destroyed her father's documents. Even a fool knew that it was all a farce.\n\nSydney was a freshman that year and Chelsea was a sophomore.\n\nAt the Quill City Fine Arts Academy, Chelsea had always been the most sought-after goddess by many in the school. After Sydney entered the school, she stole Chelsea\u2019s glory.\n\nJealousy was written all over Chelsea's innocent face.\n\nChelsea took those humiliating photos and made Sydney look cheap. Soon, other people's harsh words tormented her as well.\n\nSydney, you are so pretty. If You planned turns a resentful woman,would your grandma still need to be a cleaner in her old age to support the family?\n\n\"Sydney! Hey, Sydney!\"\n\nXavier's words pulled her back from her thoughts.\n\nShe turned her head blankly to be met with a pair of gentle, concerned eyes.\n\nXavier saw her motionless and thought she had died with her eyes wide open.\n\nThe speed of the car was fast, and the pressure on her back felt comfortable. Sydney took the pills earlier and felt better because her discomfort was suppressed. Her ears still hurt but she could hear clearly.\n\n\"Xavier, thank you.\"\n\nXavier breathed out, \"As long as you're fine.\"\n\nSydney continued to be silent.\n\nIt was already four o'clock in the middle of the night. There were very few cars on the road.\n\nAfter Xavier turned a corner, he looked back at her.\n\nHis Adam's apple rolled quietly once more.\n\nSydney looked bright and charming from the front, but she looked even more striking with her smooth facial outline and high nose from the side. Her thick eyelashes were naturally curled; It felt like she was God\u2019s favorite.\n\nSydney stood out even among beauties and was considered stunning. She was spotted by a talent scout when she hit puberty in her first year of high school.\n\nHowever, her mother refused to allow her to enter the entertainment industry, so she had been keeping her head down at school. Initially, her mother had strict requirements. Sydney was not allowed to have long hair or wear nice clothes.\n\nThroughout high school, she had ugly short hair and wore puffy, outdated and tacky clothes. She was bullied when she started dressing up in college. It was not until she fell in love with that Black Sheep Enzo that she began to step out of her shell because she had someone to protect her.\n\nXavier broke the silence in the car again. \"You knew that all the boys have only known Lorenzo in the past three or four years. Am I right to say that you and Lorenzo have known each other for a long time?\"\n\nWith that, Sydney said, \"Yeah, he was my first love. I dated him when I was a freshman. He stayed with me throughout my college days for four years. We broke up when I graduated...\"\n\n\"After two years of separation, the elders in our respective families crossed paths by accident, and they arranged for us to get married for some reason. I was willing to get married, but he was not.\"\n\nXavier frowned. \"Do you...love him very much?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Sydney\u2019s voice trembled again, \"He used to be... very good to me. Extremely good.\"\n\nShe was deeply caught up by their love, whereby a simple sentence could dig up those heavy and profound memories.\n\n\"I don't have a father. Lorenzo not only gave me the sense of security that a boyfriend should, but he was protective like a father.\n\n\"For every holiday, others are picked up by their parents, but Lorenzo picked me up. At every start of the school season, parents would send their kids to class, but Lorenzo would send me. The day before school started, he would help me check my luggage. He would make sure I had everything I needed. He would also secretly put money into the pockets of my clothes.\u201d\n\nSydney's tears rolled down her cheeks again as she recalled those memories.\n\nXavier tightened his grip on the steering wheel. His expression became heavy. He did not expect Lorenzo to have such a tender and considerate side.\n\nHowever, tenderness and consideration were the most fearful things in a relationship because trying to move on after a breakup was tantamount to chipping away at the bones.\n\nAfter a moment, Xavier spoke, \"You are now... relying on his past kindness to you to support your marriage.\"\n\nThis sentence summed up her lonely married life for the past two years. Sydney lifted her hand and wiped her eyes, \"I am not willing to lose him. We were so good together; I really can't accept the current situation...\"\n   \n\nXavier said, \"But Sydney, have you ever thought about it? Many couples who have been estranged were once deeply in love in the past. You\u2019ve been tormenting yourself by living in the past. You will definitely meet a man who treats you better in the future.\"\n\nSydney sobbed, \"I tried moving on, but I still can't get over...\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows and changed his approach. \"Chelsea hit you, but he took Chelsea away without concern for you. Can you bear it?\"\n\nSydney was stunned for a moment. The hidden deep affection in her eyes was immediately replaced by hatred as her emotions flared up.\n\n\"No, I told Lorenzo from the start that anyone who is friends with Chelsea is my enemy. Did Lorenzo really have feelings for Chelsea, or did he do it deliberately to spite me...\n\n\"No, I can't think like that either,\" she began to mumble through her chaotic thoughts, \"No matter what his purpose is, if he really slept with Chelsea...\"\n\nShe did not continue, but closed her eyes and began to take deep breaths.\n\nSome scenes were just fantasies, but enough to suffocate her.\n\nXavier's heart ached a little when he saw Sydney in pain. At the same time, he was also curious about what happened between Sydney and Chelsea.\n\nJust as he was about to ask, his cell phone, which he had thrown inside the armrest storage, rang.\n\nHe looked down. It was a call from Lorenzo.\n\nXavier frowned, turned over his phone and clicked to hang up. He glanced in the rearview mirror again.\n\nBehind him was a flashy, black and red car, the world\u2019s rarest supercar. A toy owned by the richest man in Quill City.\n\nXavier looked at Sydney again. Her sobs could really melt a man's heart. He secretly gripped the steering wheel.\n\nIt was not Sydney who gave him her number first. The men, including him, noticed Lorenzo's indifference towards her, but were too captivated by her beauty, so they asked for it behind Lorenzo's back.\n\nOf course, they all found a perfect reason. They asked Sydney to leave her number, so they could contact her for business purposes.\n\nAt that time, no one dared to have filthy intentions. She was Lorenzo's legal wife, and Lorenzo was one of the most outstanding people among his friends.\n\nAside from the fact that Sydney was married, she was indeed a rare beauty. Everyone thought it was harmless to keep a beautiful woman\u2019s phone number.\n\nHowever, things were different now.\n\nHe swerved the steering wheel abruptly and turned around in the opposite direction. He accelerated to 200 miles an hour, and threw Lorenzo off his trail.\n\nChapter 0005\nXavier was driving dangerously fast, but his expression was exceptionally calm.\n\nIn addition to running several companies, he was also a part-time F2 racing driver.\n\nFor Lorenzo, the supercar was just a means of transportation, but in Xavier's hands, it was a toy. He was sure that Lorenzo would not be able to catch up.\n\nLorenzo watched Xavier's car zoom by his car like a ghost. He was stunned for a moment and quickly turned around. Two minutes later, he lost them.\n\nHe continued to call Xavier while flooring the accelerator, but still no one answered.\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier knew that he had other intentions when he ditched Lorenzo, but he dared not show it in front of Sydney right away.\n\nAfter all, she was still Lorenzo's wife. Xavier was one year younger than Lorenzo whom he regarded as his blood brother, so she was his sister-in-law, in a sense.\n\nHe took her to the hospital as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter the medical check-up to make sure there were no major problems, Xavier took Sydney back to Celestial Park after applying ice patches to her face.\n\nCelestial Park was a famous luxury residential area in Quill City. Sydney and Lorenzo bought their marital home here.\n\nAs soon as Sydney got to the bedroom, she saw Lorenzo sitting on the sofa at the end of the bed. There was a bottle of white wine on the round table next to him.\n\nSydney's eyes flashed. Without saying a word, she went to bed, lay down, and closed her eyes.\n\nA few seconds later, the man's footsteps were heard.\n\nSydney shivered. Her eyelashes became wet again.\n\nLorenzo suddenly got on the bed and pressed on her. She opened her eyes and started to push him away. \"Don't touch me...\"\n\nLorenzo paused, grabbed her collar with both hands, and tore her skirt apart.\n\nSydney's eyes widened with shock. Her screams echoed through the bedroom. \"Don't touch me with the hand you used to touch Chelsea Dune!\"\n\nLorenzo froze.\n\nSydney looked at him as tears poured down her face. \"I can have no dignity in front of you because we were dependent on each other for those four years. You provided a great deal for me, and you are also the closest person to me besides my mother and grandmother. My heart breaks for you because you were hurt by what happened back then. I can\u2019t bear to see you in deep pain every day because of me so I allow you to vent your grievances by hurting me!\n\n\u201cBut I can't share the same man with Chelsea, and I can't have the hand that touched her, touch me!!\n\n\u201cShe is the last straw of my dignity, Lorenzo!\"\n\nHowever, these words did not move Lorenzo to show any guilt.\n\nInstead, he became angrier. \"What about my last straw?\"\n\n\"I was disgusted by you too after Oliver touched you. What you do that night when we got registered?\"\n  \nSydney trembled. She choked.\n\nThat night.\n  \nHer mother and mother-in-law both wanted to seize the opportunity so that she and Lorenzo could have a child as soon as possible, so they tampered with their tea.\n\nLorenzo thought it was Sydney who Framed him.\n\n\"Why aren't you talking?\" Lorenzo's eyes were red as he stared into hers, \"Where did Xavier take you? He deliberately didn't answer my call. What did you do?\"\n\n\"Can you stop being suspicious of everyone and anyone? He took me to the hospital!\"\n\n\"Hospital?\" Lorenzo sneered, and he tightened his grip on her clothes, this time tearing her skirt all the way, \"Sydney, lift your legs for me!\"\n\nSydney panicked. \"What are you going to do?!\"\n\n\"Let's see if you betrayed me again!\"\n\nSydney immediately closed her knees together, \"I didn't!\"\n\nLorenzo pressed harder and his voice became more forceful, \"I don't believe a word you said!\"\n\nSuch stubborn words made Sydney lose the will to refute him.\n\nShe looked at Lorenzo\u2019s frightening and gloomy face and felt disgusted with him for the first time.\n\nShe reached out and pinched the back of his hand. \"Let me go, I'm tired, I want to sleep!\"\n\n\"I don't want to sleep, why should you sleep!\" Lorenzo was still furious. He did not seem to feel any pain in the back of his hand. The grip in his hand became stronger and stronger.\n\nHe pulled apart Sydney's knees quickly. He spread her legs apart so hard that even her behinds hurt.\n\nHe was worried that she would resist, so he pressed his knee on her belly and untied his belt.\n\nSydney's tears rolled to the side of her temples and wet the pillow. Still, she said nothing. Since pinching the back of his hand did not work, she pinched his neck hard.\n\nLorenzo winced in pain, but still did not let her go.\n\nIt felt as if he would not give up if he did not test her.\n\nLorenzo's neck,and even his arms and abdominal muscles were left bruised from Sydney's pinching while she gradually lost hope.\n\nShe wilted like dry roses, losing all trace of vitality.\n\nLorenzo endured the pain and tried to control her, but failed.\n\nSydney's tearful eyes trembled. Her hand squeezing his chest loosened, and she finally spoke again, \"Is that enough?\"\n\n\"Enough?\" Unexpectedly, Lorenzo felt even more enraged. He reached out and yanked open the drawer on the bedside table, took out the bottle of essential oil she bought, and then slammed the drawer shut!\n\nSydney seized this opportunity and tried to escape, but he grabbed her ankle in time. \"Be good!\"\n\nSydney stopped resisting. She knew she would not be able to escape tonight.\n\nShe was in tears, but she laughed. \"Lorenzo, I really didn't expect that one day I would be disgusted with you. Go ahead, disgust me more. So I can hate you enough, and give you what you want...\"\n\nShe thought, \u2018Lorenzo should know what I was referring to.\u2019\n\nIn the split second, her refusal to sign the divorce agreement suddenly wavered.\n\nDuring the time between being taken away by Xavier and being sent back home, she had been recalling the past.\n\nWhen she recalled the past with Chelsea, she did not want to lose her self-esteem. However, when she recalled every moment with Lorenzo, she did not want to regret losing the man she loved most.\n\nShe was deeply confused by these opposing feelings.\n\nHowever, right now, she actually felt disgusted with the man she loved most.\n\nShe was glad.\n\nDisgusted by him meant that she could finally let him go one day. \n\nLorenzo's face darkened at Sydney\u2019s words. He could not tell whether he was angry or something else.\n\nShe wanted to say more, but Lorenzo's lips suddenly covered hers.\n\nAt the same time, his fingertips of both hands trailed up along her waistline.\n\nThe faint smell of tobacco mixed with the fragrance and wine was an alluring masculine aroma. In the past, she could never resist his kisses.\n\nLorenzo was even wilder in the past than he is now. He was like a lion in the savanna. The passion and impulse he made her feel was strong and without restraint.\n\nApart from the four years they were separated, they had slept together for four years until now. He understood every part of her body, her preferred tension and pressure.\n\nSoon, her body reacted uncontrollably."

                      "text": "Chapter 0001\nIt was ten o'clock in the evening. Sydney Castro sat in front of the dressing table, rubbing essential oils on her body for that glowing skin.\n\nClearly, she was getting ready to please a man.\n\nHer husband, whom she had not seen for two years, was returning to Somerland today. She missed him terribly.\n\nSydney oiled every part of her body until she was soft and smooth. Then she put on a white, furry lingerie set with a cheeky little cat tail on the small of her back.\n\nIn truth, she did not have to go to such trouble in the past. Lorenzo had wished he could stick to her every day, but after that fateful day, everything changed.\n\nShe went from being his closest lover to the woman he hated the most.\n\nLater, their elders arranged for them to get married. However, Lorenzo was so reluctant that he left the country the day after signing their marriage certificate.\n\nNow two years have passed, during which he only contacted her once. It was six months after her mother's death that he sent her a divorce agreement.\n\nSydney did not sign the papers. She still harbored thoughts of rekindling her marriage with Lorenzo.\n\nHowever, it was difficult.\n\nShe was not even aware he was returning tonight. She only found out when she saw Lorenzo\u2019s friends posted about their drinking session on social media.\n\nLater, she called her mother-in-law, who helped her and sent a driver to bring Lorenzo back.\n\nThe driver called. Lorenzo would be home in a few minutes.\n\nShe had to seize this opportunity and try to rekindle their old flame again.\n\nIntentionally dressed up, she knelt on fours by the bed, evenly distributing the rose petals that had been sprinkled on the bed in advance. She was so engrossed that she did not notice a long shadow walking in.\n\nSuddenly, Sydney\u2019s cat tail was yanked hard as a hot-blooded torso pressed on her back. Her heart skipped a beat. She turned back and came face-to-face with a deep yet intense set of piercing eyes.\n\n\"Enzo...\" she began delicately, \"You finally came...\" Back.\n\nThe rest of her sentence was choked back by a kiss reeking of ethanol.\n\nSydney's eyelashes fluttered as her body responded to his. She was not sure whether Lorenzo was drunk or if her outfit tonight was a success. \n\nLorenzo kissed her so passionately that he wanted to suck her lips swollen. He placed his hands over her waist , grabbing them vigorously.\n\nThe man seemed satisfied. While taking a breath, he growled in a whisper. \"good...\"\n\nGrowling in a whisper was considered flirting. That was Lorenzo\u2019s special habit. \n\nRecently, she had been doing yoga. Her figure was way better than two years ago. This was also a surprise for Lorenzo. His words and actions ignited the fire in her heart.\n\nHer plump waist rose and fell violently. Her rapid breath escaped her rosy lips. Her glowy, fair hands explored his waist through his custom silk shirt, caressing his hard and steamy muscles for the first time in a long time. She hurriedly unbuttoned his shirt.\n\nThe smooth material slid down his strong arms. She unbuckled his belt and wrapped her legs around his waist.\n\nEight years of familiarity with each other made them very compatible in bed. No need for any fluff, they went straight into it.\n\nPerhaps it was because they had not seen each other for too long. His desire seemed to be even more intense than hers, just like when he first tasted the forbidden fruit eight years ago. The man was excited and tireless.\n\nThis went on for more than three hours. Finally, he was satisfied.\n\nSydney laid on the man's beautiful sculpted chest and kissed his handsome face obsessively, trying to make up for lost time.\n\nLorenzo kept his eyes closed, allowing her kisses.\n\n \"I'm very pleased with you tonight.\"Lorenzo said\n\nSydney smiled and kissed the corner of his lips again.\n\nLorenzo raised the corners of his lips. He grabbed her waist hard, and turned over to hold her down.\n\nSydney was sure that he was in a good mood now.\n\nShe stretched out her hand to rub his Adam's apple. Right before they did it again, she said bluntly, \"Enzo, four years ago\u2026I swear nothing happened between Oliver and I. My body and soul completely belong to you. You are finally back. Can we please forget what happened that day and move forward together?\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the smile on the man's face froze instantly.\n\nLorenzo raised his hand and grabbed Sydney\u2019s throat. \n\nSydney's heart skipped a beat. She widened her eyes in panic. It was over. She had said the wrong thing.\n\nThis happened twice before. If she mentioned the words \"four years ago\", Lorenzo would immediately become ruthless and sinister.\n\nHer best friend once said that Lorenzo's reaction was akin to PTSD, a post-traumatic stress reaction.\n\nShe had doubts at the time, and it turned out to be the same today, which proved that her best friend was right.\n\nIn a daze, she heard Lorenzo say, \"Move forward with me? You?\n\n\"I touched you tonight because I'm afraid that you,  wouldn\u2019t change your disgusting habit and sleep with my friends again!\"\n\n\"I won't, I didn\u2019t...\" Sydney explained and reached out to touch his hand, attempting to soothe him.\n\nLorenzo's hand tightened, \"Don't touch me!\"\n\nSydney's face was red from Lorenzo\u2019s grip on her throat.\n\nLorenzo took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. \"You'd better sign the divorce agreement as soon as possible. The past love we had will never be rekindled.\"\n\n The words \u2018divorce agreement\u2019 stabbed Sydney\u2019s heart like a sword. She looked up anxiously, and said with difficulty, \"We were so good back then. Are you going to completely deny all that I\u2019ve done for you, just because of that incident?\n\n\"Oliver and I both explained back then that nothing happened to us. We were set up!\"\n\nHowever, the more she explained, the angrier Lorenzo became. His hand went up her neck and grabbed her chin. The force in his grip became stronger and stronger. Sydney could feel that he wanted to crush her chin.\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\nHe ignored her cries of pain.\n\n\"Set up? Lying on the same bed with him might be a set up, but what about the child in your belly?\"\n\n\"Sydney, I wanted so badly for that baby to be mine at that time... But all the hospitals we went to in Quill City showed the same result: You were fifteen days conceived a baby.!\n\n\"I was on a business trip for two months and you were fifteen days conceived a baby. How could you make me believe that nothing happened between you and him?!\"\n\nAfter that, Lorenzo shook her off.\n\nSydney fell on the pillow. She straightened her messy hair, stood up again and explained shakily, \"But the first doctor I consulted was a traditional medicine practitioner. The old doctor said that I was two months conceived a baby. I didn't tell you immediately because I wanted to wait for you to come back to give you a surprise!\n\n\"You\u2019ve met that old doctor too. He showed you the prescription he gave me with the time written on it. Why won't you...\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Lorenzo interrupted her, \"Handwritten time has no credibility, and it's easier to bribe an old traditional medicine practitioner. Stop now and shut up!\"\n\nShe stood in his shoes and could understand the hurt in his heart. However, she still felt heartbroken from how he decisively shunned her.\n\nEspecially their child. The rejection was heartbreakingly painful.\n\nShe knew it was useless to say anything, so she kept quiet and shed tears of frustration.\n\nLorenzo got out of bed and made a phone call.\n\nThe room was quiet. As the call connected, Sydney heard the voice on the other end. She quickly got out of bed.\n\nA woman\u2019s voice. \"Mr. Bailey\u2026\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"Are you still here?\"\n\nWoman, \"Yes, do you want to come over?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lorenzo said and hung up the phone. \n\nSydney held him back. Her eyes widened with tears and her voice trembled. \"Are you seeing someone else?\"\n\nChapter 0002\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\nSydney\u2019s world collapsed as she burst into tears. \"When did it happen?! Who is she?!\"\n\nShe looked utterly miserable now. Lorenzo had no mercy, he might have even felt a little pleasure seeing her in pain.\n\n\"Can\u2019t stand seeing me with someone else?\"\n\nYes, she could not stand it.\n\nLoving a person would inherently make one possessive. Lorenzo meant so much to her that she could not accept losing him.\n\nAt this moment, the way she was just speechlessly hyperventilating due to the blow was more pathetic than crying. It felt like she was falling to pieces.\n\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He got dressed and left the bedroom.\n\nSydney refused to give up and chased after him. \"Why won\u2019t you believe that I was set up?\"\n\nLorenzo stopped and turned around. \"Then tell me, who set you up?\"\n\nThe corridor of the mansion was wide and long. Sydney was speechless as she looked at the lanky man in white shirt and trousers.    \n\nFour years ago, they talked about this many times. Each time they got stuck here.\n\nExactly.\n\nShe still did not find out who did it.\n\nThe setup was extremely vicious.\n\nLorenzo and Sydney\u2019s relationship turned from true love to pure hatred. They were so miserable for each other that it broke apart Lorenzo and Oliver\u2019s friendship. It also caused Sydney to become mentally ill, miscarrying from extreme heartache...\n\nHowever, she still could not identify the mastermind behind this! Four years ago, Sydney and Oliver searched for a long time but to no avail.\n\nLorenzo left.\n\nSydney stood in the corridor for a long time. She clutched her chest and raced towards the room at the corner of the corridor, calling out with each step, \"Mrs. Harper...\"\n\nHer breath became shorter each time.\n\nWhen she reached the door, she reached out and knocked, then her vision went dark as she fell to the ground unconscious.\n\nThe door opened shortly. The nanny had the shock of her life and quickly picked Sydney up in panic. \"Madam!\"\n\nThe sound of a car driving away was heard downstairs.\n\nSydney regained consciousness after Mrs. Harper gave her first aid.\n\nMrs. Harper had a glass of water and a handful of white pills in her hand. She said, \"Madam, why don't you tell your husband about your condition? If he sympathizes with you because of this, you might...\"\n\nSydney shook her head stubbornly, \"He and I are together because we love each other. I don't want to be pitied.\"\n\nShe took the pills and swallowed them. She closed her eyes and kept silent for a long time, then she said to Mrs. Harper, \"He\u2019s seeing someone else. I want to know who she is. Tell me, is it okay for me to ask his friends?\"\n\n\u2026\n\nMelon, the largest nightclub in Quill City.\n\nMusic was blaring in a VIP room. Lorenzo kicked the door open and went in. The men who were dancing intimately with the women almost soiled their pants.\n\nHowever, no one dared to be angry.\n\nLorenzo was a peculiar legend in Quill City. In his youth, he was an uncivilized and rebellious devil. Despite being a member of the Bailey Group, the wealthiest corporation in Quill City, he was cast out as the black sheep of the family and was dead broke.\n\nLater, his parents could not stand it anymore and made a plan for him to study abroad. He refused without hesitation. Instead, he relied on the prize money he got from a gaming tournament and simply enrolled himself in a vocational school.\n\nSuch a self-destructive person suddenly changed at the age of twenty.\n\nLorenzo became extremely hard-working. He diligently went to class and hung out in the library. He would also dress up and leave the dormitory at around six o'clock every morning. He rode the bicycle for an hour to Quill City Fine Arts Academy for lectures.\n\nSome people claimed that he had fallen in love with a student from Quill City Fine Arts Academy.\n\nNot long after, he wanted to start a company. His family was not supportive, of course. So, he put a knife to Grandpa Bailey\u2019s throat and grabbed 300 million to open a jewelry company, registered as Cherr.y.\n\nAt that time, the Baileys thought that the 300 million was burned for good. However, Cherr.y turned out to be unexpectedly successful. It made ten times the profit in its second year. In the fourth year, it was listed in Newford.\n\nToday, the \u2018Black Sheep\u2019 was a self-made man and had become the heir to the Bailey Group. Cherr.y had become a world-renowned jewelry brand.\n\nAs soon as Lorenzo sat down on the sofa, a group of beauties quickly came over and said, \"Mr. Bailey!\"\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nThe women trembled in fright and scurried away. Two more men sat down and said, \"Lorenzo, what pissed you off at home?\"\n\nLorenzo kept quiet. He picked up a glass and started chugging.\n\nThe others did not say anything anymore. They picked up their glass to drink with him.\n\nNot a moment later, someone's cell phone rang on the table.\n\n\"Xavier, your phone!\"\n\nA handsome man with platinum blond hair sat up on the sofa in a dark hidden corner.\n\nXavier woke up from his nap and scratched his tattooed neck. He took a look at his cell phone and his eyes widened.\n\n\"Lorenzo,\" he looked at Lorenzo, \"Why is Sydney calling me?\"\n\nLorenzo paused mid-drink and looked at Xavier. \"Who?\"\n\nXavier walked up to him with his cell phone, \"Your wife!\"\n\nLorenzo's expression turned sinister. \"When did you get her number?\"\n\nXavier said casually, \"On the day you both got married, I gave her my number when we sang together in the karaoke bar.\"\n\nHearing that, Lorenzo stood up abruptly and grabbed Xavier's collar, \"Who asked you to give your number?\"\n\nXavier frowned, puzzled at his friend\u2019s sudden rage. He pushed Lorenzo's hand away, \"We were all having fun, what\u2019s the big deal in exchanging contact information?\"\n\nLorenzo got angry. \"WHY\"\n\nWith that, he punched the undefended Xavier.\n\nXavier was caught off guard and slammed onto the marble table. The wine and glasses on the table clattered onto the floor.\n\nThe atmosphere froze. Lorenzo's eyes turned red like a furious beast. He growled, \"Delete her number!\"\n\nXavier was no sitting duck either. He was the second generation of the Altmans, an old money family in Quill City.  He was the prodigal son of the Altmans, a notorious troublemaker. He could hang out frequently with Lorenzo because they were similar.\n\nXavier wiped the bleeding corner of his lips and punched Lorenzo in return. \"What's going on, Popeye? Use your words, not your fists!\"\n\nLorenzo was hit on the head. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then he grabbed Xavier, pressed him on the sofa and beat him in a frenzy. \"How many times have you contacted Sydney in the past two years?!!\"\n\nXavier dodged Lorenzo's heavy punches and said, \"Why would I contact your wife like I have nothing else to do?! Have you gone mad? I'll admit you to the mental hospital!\"\n\nThese words seemed to hit a nerve. Lorenzo paused. \n\nHe was stunned for a few seconds. Then, he sat down on the side and then closed his eyes to quell the anger in his heart.\n\nXavier sat up, frowned and rubbed his shoulders. Vulgarities spewed.\n\nLorenzo ignored Xavier. After a while, he calmed down. He opened his eagle eyes and scanned the other men in the room, \"Who else saved her number?\"\n\nImmediately, several men lowered their heads to look for their phones.\n\nLorenzo was startled.\n\nImmediately, terrifying sounds of broken bottles filled the space, as well as Lorenzo's angry swear words, and screams of women as they dodge shards of glass.\n\nLorenzo seemed to have lost his mind and started attacking all his friends.\n\nXavier stepped outside with his cell phone and returned Sydney\u2019s call.\n\nWhen Sydney picked up, Xavier humbly said, \"Hi, Sydney. What's the matter?\"\n\nSydney's voice was gentle and polite. \"Xavier, I'm sorry to bother you. Lorenzo got a little upset with me tonight. He blocked me and I can't contact him. I wanted to ask if you know where he is.\"\n\nChapter 0003\n\"He was drinking with me, and now he's drunk and acting crazy. I'll send him back to you later. Don\u2019t worry.\"\n\nSydney paused for a moment then said, \"Can you give me the address? I want to check on him myself.\"\n\nXavier took a deep breath, opened the door and saw the chaos inside. He said, \"Melon, A.\"\n\nAbout ten minutes later, apart from Lorenzo and Xavier, everyone else left.\n\nLorenzo sat on the sofa. He stared at the chandelier on the ceiling, lost in thoughts.\n\nXavier sat next to him, \"We are not a part of your drama with Sydney. If anything, go home and solve it with her. Don't go crazy here.\"\n\nLorenzo closed his eyes. \"I\u2019m not going home.\"\n\n\"You must,\" \"Then tell me what happened between you two, I\u2019ll find a way for you.\"\n\nLorenzo, \"You can't.\"\n\n\u201cFine,\" Xavier said, \"If you won't go home, where will you go later?\"\n\n\"Chelsea will pick me up.\"\n\nXavier was stunned for a moment. \"Are you okay? You got so anxious when your wife called me. And now you\u2019re going to see another woman?\n\n\"I met you late. I don't know what happened between you and Sydney. You left her alone for two years, acting like you really don't care. However, we are not allowed to keep her contact information. What on earth are you thinking?\"\n\nLorenzo became impatient again. \"Boy, don\u2019t meddle with adult matters.\"\n\nWhen Xavier started to curse, a creaking sound came from the door. The two of them looked towards the door.\n\n\u201cEnzo,\u201d A sweet voice came.\n\nThe woman had the body of a devil and the face of an angel as she slithered in. She was the \u2018Nation\u2019s Goddess\u2019 and top tier actress, Chelsea Dune.\n \nLorenzo's expression finally softened a little when she appeared. \"Here she comes.\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows subtly.\n\nChelsea elegantly sat next to Lorenzo while avoiding the mess on the ground. She saw the cut at the corner of his eye.\n\nThe woman frowned. \"Why are you hurt?\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"It's nothing. I just drank too much.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt?\" As she spoke, Chelsea reached out and took Lorenzo's arm.\n\nXavier said with a smile, \"Hey Superstar, do you know he is married?\"\n\nChelsea paused and retracted her hand in embarrassment. \"Enzo and I are just friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, cool.\"\n\nLorenzo seemed displeased with Xavier's sarcasm towards Chelsea. He retorted, \"What are you trying to say?\"\n\nXavier stuck his tongue in his cheek and stood up with a grin. \"Nothing. Things among you guys are too complicated for my little brain. I\u2019m gonna go home to bed.\"\n\nAs soon as Xavier reached the door, the door was opened from the outside.\n\nXavier paused.\n\nSydney stood timidly at the door.\n\nShe was timid but she was objectively eye-catching.\n\nHer long, dark and wavy hair draped casually down her back. She had light makeup on her delicate and pretty face. Her lips were as bright as cherry, with a hint of sparkle.\n\nThe velvet, burgundy strappy dress contrasted with her flawless, snow-white skin. She was like a blooming red rose in the dark night.\n\nXavier gulped. He forgot how to speak at that moment.\n\nLorenzo's voice was suddenly heard. \"Who\u2019s there?\"\n\nXavier was stunned,and stepped aside to make way for Sydney. After Sydney entered the room, he exhaled and came back to his senses.\n\nAs soon as Sydney reached the door, she froze.\n\nEveryone had left. The private room had the brightest lights turned on. Right in the middle, Lorenzo and Chelsea were sitting together with their arms touching each other. To Sydney, that scene hurt her eyes more than the light.\n\nHer breath was stuck in her throat. Her lips quivered, but she could not say a word.\n\nLorenzo had an affair with Chelsea, her college bully!\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Lorenzo frowned, \"Go back!\"\n\nSydney shuddered then finally took a step. She quickened her pace.\n\nShe went up to the two of them. While everyone was caught off guard, she slapped Chelsea across the face and grabbed her hair. \"It's you!\"\n\nChelsea screamed, \"Ah! Enzo, help me!\"\n\n\u201cSydney!\u201d\n\nWhen Lorenzo spoke, Sydney let go of Chelsea. She raised her hand towards Lorenzo, but did not strike him.\n\nHer hands trembled. She broke down and shouted, \"You clearly know what she did to me back then! Of all the people, why her?!\"\n\nSuddenly.\n\nSlap!\n\nChelsea took advantage when Sydney was unguarded and slapped her back. That slap was even harder than Sydney\u2019s.\n\nSydney felt ringing in her ears, and then blood dripped from the corners of her lips.\n\nChelsea snarled, \"Why blame others if you can't keep your man?!\"\n\nSydney held her face. Her eyes turned red at Chelsea\u2019s smug expression. She shouted, \"I'm taking your life. \n\nShe tried to attack Chelsea again, but Lorenzo stopped her. He grabbed the back of her head and threw her to the other side of the sofa.\n\n\"I told you to go back, are you deaf?\"\n\nSydney felt as if she had gone deaf. The ringing in her ears was so severe that she couldn't hear what Lorenzo said. Half of her head was throbbing.\n\nAt this moment, Chelsea suddenly covered her ears and wailed, \"Enzo, I can't hear!\"\n\nLorenzo was shocked, \"You can\u2019t hear?\"\n\nChelsea's eyes widened in pity, and her cries became louder. \"I can't hear what you said...\"\n\nLorenzo looked back and glared at Sydney fiercely. He stood up, arms over Chelsea and walked out, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier, saw Lorenzo escorting a tearful Chelsea out of the room. He knew something was amiss and quickly entered the room.\n\nSydney closed her eyes and clasped her head with her hands. She fell sideways on the sofa. Her shoulders shook.\n\nAt the moment, half of that bright and charming face was as pale as paper, and the other half was marked with an angry palm print. The blood on the corners of her lips stood out even more.\n\nXavier's eyes widened and he rushed over. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney did not respond.\n\nXavier nudged her gently. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney then opened her eyes, her voice fading away, \"My, my ears hurt...\"\n\nWith the slap mark and her ear hurting, Xavier immediately understood what had happened. He helped Sydney up and said, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\nSydney only managed to take two steps before her legs gave way. She was about to crash.\n\nPeople lose strength when they cannot bear the pain. Sydney would rather die than have Lorenzo cheated on her with Chelsea.\n\nXavier felt a pang of distress. He carried Sydney in his arms and hurried out.\n\n\u2026\n\nLorenzo and Chelsea stopped outside the main entrance of Melon. He said, \"Wait for me here, I'll get the car.\"\n\nChelsea held him and said, \"Enzo, I'm better now. I don\u2019t think I need to go to the hospital. Come with me and stay with me, okay?\"\n\nLorenzo frowned, and just as he was about to agree, something behind Chelsea attracted his attention.\n\nXavier carried Sydney and walked quickly towards the parking lot.\n\nLorenzo frowned, \"Since you don't need to go to the hospital, you should go back to the hotel first.\"\n\nWith that, he turned to chase after Xavier, but Chelsea pulled him back. \"Are you going to look for Sydney? How could she treat you like that but you still can't let her go?\"\n\nChapter 0004\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He did not answer and strode after Xavier.\n\nChelsea exhaled forcefully. Her shoulders trembled. She looked at Sydney and Xavier with clear hatred and jealousy.\n\nHowever, Lorenzo did not manage to intercept Xavier. When he passed by, Xavier's car drifted gorgeously before merging onto the main freeway.\n\n\u2026\n\nInside the car.\n\nSydney crumpled into a ball and leaned against the car window. Xavier fastened the seat belt for her.\n\nTears streamed down her face the whole time, but she was expressionless, like a soulless sculpture.\n\nThe pain in her ear strained the nerves across her head, and pulled out many memories that she did not want to recall.\n\nA group of heavily made-up girls surrounded her. The proudest one leading the pack, was Chelsea, the one with the harmless face.\n\nHer smile was pure evil. She pulled Sydney\u2019s hair, and let her companions take turns to slap her. Chelsea dripped melted white ice cream on Sydney\u2019s face and chest.\n\nSydney dared not resist because her grandmother, Mary Collins, was in the hands of Christopher, Chelsea's father.\n\nThe Dunes were quite wealthy. Christopher owned a ceramics company, and Mary used to work as a cleaner in Christopher\u2019s office building.\n\nMary had always done a good job, but that day Chelsea insisted that Mary accidentally destroyed her father's documents. Even a fool knew that it was all a farce.\n\nSydney was a freshman that year and Chelsea was a sophomore.\n\nAt the Quill City Fine Arts Academy, Chelsea had always been the most sought-after goddess by many in the school. After Sydney entered the school, she stole Chelsea\u2019s glory.\n\nJealousy was written all over Chelsea's innocent face.\n\nChelsea took those humiliating photos and made Sydney look cheap. Soon, other people's harsh words tormented her as well.\n\nSydney, you are so pretty. If You planned turns a resentful woman,would your grandma still need to be a cleaner in her old age to support the family?\n\n\"Sydney! Hey, Sydney!\"\n\nXavier's words pulled her back from her thoughts.\n\nShe turned her head blankly to be met with a pair of gentle, concerned eyes.\n\nXavier saw her motionless and thought she had died with her eyes wide open.\n\nThe speed of the car was fast, and the pressure on her back felt comfortable. Sydney took the pills earlier and felt better because her discomfort was suppressed. Her ears still hurt but she could hear clearly.\n\n\"Xavier, thank you.\"\n\nXavier breathed out, \"As long as you're fine.\"\n\nSydney continued to be silent.\n\nIt was already four o'clock in the middle of the night. There were very few cars on the road.\n\nAfter Xavier turned a corner, he looked back at her.\n\nHis Adam's apple rolled quietly once more.\n\nSydney looked bright and charming from the front, but she looked even more striking with her smooth facial outline and high nose from the side. Her thick eyelashes were naturally curled; It felt like she was God\u2019s favorite.\n\nSydney stood out even among beauties and was considered stunning. She was spotted by a talent scout when she hit puberty in her first year of high school.\n\nHowever, her mother refused to allow her to enter the entertainment industry, so she had been keeping her head down at school. Initially, her mother had strict requirements. Sydney was not allowed to have long hair or wear nice clothes.\n\nThroughout high school, she had ugly short hair and wore puffy, outdated and tacky clothes. She was bullied when she started dressing up in college. It was not until she fell in love with that Black Sheep Enzo that she began to step out of her shell because she had someone to protect her.\n\nXavier broke the silence in the car again. \"You knew that all the boys have only known Lorenzo in the past three or four years. Am I right to say that you and Lorenzo have known each other for a long time?\"\n\nWith that, Sydney said, \"Yeah, he was my first love. I dated him when I was a freshman. He stayed with me throughout my college days for four years. We broke up when I graduated...\"\n\n\"After two years of separation, the elders in our respective families crossed paths by accident, and they arranged for us to get married for some reason. I was willing to get married, but he was not.\"\n\nXavier frowned. \"Do you...love him very much?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Sydney\u2019s voice trembled again, \"He used to be... very good to me. Extremely good.\"\n\nShe was deeply caught up by their love, whereby a simple sentence could dig up those heavy and profound memories.\n\n\"I don't have a father. Lorenzo not only gave me the sense of security that a boyfriend should, but he was protective like a father.\n\n\"For every holiday, others are picked up by their parents, but Lorenzo picked me up. At every start of the school season, parents would send their kids to class, but Lorenzo would send me. The day before school started, he would help me check my luggage. He would make sure I had everything I needed. He would also secretly put money into the pockets of my clothes.\u201d\n\nSydney's tears rolled down her cheeks again as she recalled those memories.\n\nXavier tightened his grip on the steering wheel. His expression became heavy. He did not expect Lorenzo to have such a tender and considerate side.\n\nHowever, tenderness and consideration were the most fearful things in a relationship because trying to move on after a breakup was tantamount to chipping away at the bones.\n\nAfter a moment, Xavier spoke, \"You are now... relying on his past kindness to you to support your marriage.\"\n\nThis sentence summed up her lonely married life for the past two years. Sydney lifted her hand and wiped her eyes, \"I am not willing to lose him. We were so good together; I really can't accept the current situation...\"\n   \n\nXavier said, \"But Sydney, have you ever thought about it? Many couples who have been estranged were once deeply in love in the past. You\u2019ve been tormenting yourself by living in the past. You will definitely meet a man who treats you better in the future.\"\n\nSydney sobbed, \"I tried moving on, but I still can't get over...\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows and changed his approach. \"Chelsea hit you, but he took Chelsea away without concern for you. Can you bear it?\"\n\nSydney was stunned for a moment. The hidden deep affection in her eyes was immediately replaced by hatred as her emotions flared up.\n\n\"No, I told Lorenzo from the start that anyone who is friends with Chelsea is my enemy. Did Lorenzo really have feelings for Chelsea, or did he do it deliberately to spite me...\n\n\"No, I can't think like that either,\" she began to mumble through her chaotic thoughts, \"No matter what his purpose is, if he really slept with Chelsea...\"\n\nShe did not continue, but closed her eyes and began to take deep breaths.\n\nSome scenes were just fantasies, but enough to suffocate her.\n\nXavier's heart ached a little when he saw Sydney in pain. At the same time, he was also curious about what happened between Sydney and Chelsea.\n\nJust as he was about to ask, his cell phone, which he had thrown inside the armrest storage, rang.\n\nHe looked down. It was a call from Lorenzo.\n\nXavier frowned, turned over his phone and clicked to hang up. He glanced in the rearview mirror again.\n\nBehind him was a flashy, black and red car, the world\u2019s rarest supercar. A toy owned by the richest man in Quill City.\n\nXavier looked at Sydney again. Her sobs could really melt a man's heart. He secretly gripped the steering wheel.\n\nIt was not Sydney who gave him her number first. The men, including him, noticed Lorenzo's indifference towards her, but were too captivated by her beauty, so they asked for it behind Lorenzo's back.\n\nOf course, they all found a perfect reason. They asked Sydney to leave her number, so they could contact her for business purposes.\n\nAt that time, no one dared to have filthy intentions. She was Lorenzo's legal wife, and Lorenzo was one of the most outstanding people among his friends.\n\nAside from the fact that Sydney was married, she was indeed a rare beauty. Everyone thought it was harmless to keep a beautiful woman\u2019s phone number.\n\nHowever, things were different now.\n\nHe swerved the steering wheel abruptly and turned around in the opposite direction. He accelerated to 200 miles an hour, and threw Lorenzo off his trail.\n\nChapter 0005\nXavier was driving dangerously fast, but his expression was exceptionally calm.\n\nIn addition to running several companies, he was also a part-time F2 racing driver.\n\nFor Lorenzo, the supercar was just a means of transportation, but in Xavier's hands, it was a toy. He was sure that Lorenzo would not be able to catch up.\n\nLorenzo watched Xavier's car zoom by his car like a ghost. He was stunned for a moment and quickly turned around. Two minutes later, he lost them.\n\nHe continued to call Xavier while flooring the accelerator, but still no one answered.\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier knew that he had other intentions when he ditched Lorenzo, but he dared not show it in front of Sydney right away.\n\nAfter all, she was still Lorenzo's wife. Xavier was one year younger than Lorenzo whom he regarded as his blood brother, so she was his sister-in-law, in a sense.\n\nHe took her to the hospital as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter the medical check-up to make sure there were no major problems, Xavier took Sydney back to Celestial Park after applying ice patches to her face.\n\nCelestial Park was a famous luxury residential area in Quill City. Sydney and Lorenzo bought their marital home here.\n\nAs soon as Sydney got to the bedroom, she saw Lorenzo sitting on the sofa at the end of the bed. There was a bottle of white wine on the round table next to him.\n\nSydney's eyes flashed. Without saying a word, she went to bed, lay down, and closed her eyes.\n\nA few seconds later, the man's footsteps were heard.\n\nSydney shivered. Her eyelashes became wet again.\n\nLorenzo suddenly got on the bed and pressed on her. She opened her eyes and started to push him away. \"Don't touch me...\"\n\nLorenzo paused, grabbed her collar with both hands, and tore her skirt apart.\n\nSydney's eyes widened with shock. Her screams echoed through the bedroom. \"Don't touch me with the hand you used to touch Chelsea Dune!\"\n\nLorenzo froze.\n\nSydney looked at him as tears poured down her face. \"I can have no dignity in front of you because we were dependent on each other for those four years. You provided a great deal for me, and you are also the closest person to me besides my mother and grandmother. My heart breaks for you because you were hurt by what happened back then. I can\u2019t bear to see you in deep pain every day because of me so I allow you to vent your grievances by hurting me!\n\n\u201cBut I can't share the same man with Chelsea, and I can't have the hand that touched her, touch me!!\n\n\u201cShe is the last straw of my dignity, Lorenzo!\"\n\nHowever, these words did not move Lorenzo to show any guilt.\n\nInstead, he became angrier. \"What about my last straw?\"\n\n\"I was disgusted by you too after Oliver touched you. What you do that night when we got registered?\"\n  \nSydney trembled. She choked.\n\nThat night.\n  \nHer mother and mother-in-law both wanted to seize the opportunity so that she and Lorenzo could have a child as soon as possible, so they tampered with their tea.\n\nLorenzo thought it was Sydney who Framed him.\n\n\"Why aren't you talking?\" Lorenzo's eyes were red as he stared into hers, \"Where did Xavier take you? He deliberately didn't answer my call. What did you do?\"\n\n\"Can you stop being suspicious of everyone and anyone? He took me to the hospital!\"\n\n\"Hospital?\" Lorenzo sneered, and he tightened his grip on her clothes, this time tearing her skirt all the way, \"Sydney, lift your legs for me!\"\n\nSydney panicked. \"What are you going to do?!\"\n\n\"Let's see if you betrayed me again!\"\n\nSydney immediately closed her knees together, \"I didn't!\"\n\nLorenzo pressed harder and his voice became more forceful, \"I don't believe a word you said!\"\n\nSuch stubborn words made Sydney lose the will to refute him.\n\nShe looked at Lorenzo\u2019s frightening and gloomy face and felt disgusted with him for the first time.\n\nShe reached out and pinched the back of his hand. \"Let me go, I'm tired, I want to sleep!\"\n\n\"I don't want to sleep, why should you sleep!\" Lorenzo was still furious. He did not seem to feel any pain in the back of his hand. The grip in his hand became stronger and stronger.\n\nHe pulled apart Sydney's knees quickly. He spread her legs apart so hard that even her behinds hurt.\n\nHe was worried that she would resist, so he pressed his knee on her belly and untied his belt.\n\nSydney's tears rolled to the side of her temples and wet the pillow. Still, she said nothing. Since pinching the back of his hand did not work, she pinched his neck hard.\n\nLorenzo winced in pain, but still did not let her go.\n\nIt felt as if he would not give up if he did not test her.\n\nLorenzo's neck,and even his arms and abdominal muscles were left bruised from Sydney's pinching while she gradually lost hope.\n\nShe wilted like dry roses, losing all trace of vitality.\n\nLorenzo endured the pain and tried to control her, but failed.\n\nSydney's tearful eyes trembled. Her hand squeezing his chest loosened, and she finally spoke again, \"Is that enough?\"\n\n\"Enough?\" Unexpectedly, Lorenzo felt even more enraged. He reached out and yanked open the drawer on the bedside table, took out the bottle of essential oil she bought, and then slammed the drawer shut!\n\nSydney seized this opportunity and tried to escape, but he grabbed her ankle in time. \"Be good!\"\n\nSydney stopped resisting. She knew she would not be able to escape tonight.\n\nShe was in tears, but she laughed. \"Lorenzo, I really didn't expect that one day I would be disgusted with you. Go ahead, disgust me more. So I can hate you enough, and give you what you want...\"\n\nShe thought, \u2018Lorenzo should know what I was referring to.\u2019\n\nIn the split second, her refusal to sign the divorce agreement suddenly wavered.\n\nDuring the time between being taken away by Xavier and being sent back home, she had been recalling the past.\n\nWhen she recalled the past with Chelsea, she did not want to lose her self-esteem. However, when she recalled every moment with Lorenzo, she did not want to regret losing the man she loved most.\n\nShe was deeply confused by these opposing feelings.\n\nHowever, right now, she actually felt disgusted with the man she loved most.\n\nShe was glad.\n\nDisgusted by him meant that she could finally let him go one day. \n\nLorenzo's face darkened at Sydney\u2019s words. He could not tell whether he was angry or something else.\n\nShe wanted to say more, but Lorenzo's lips suddenly covered hers.\n\nAt the same time, his fingertips of both hands trailed up along her waistline.\n\nThe faint smell of tobacco mixed with the fragrance and wine was an alluring masculine aroma. In the past, she could never resist his kisses.\n\nLorenzo was even wilder in the past than he is now. He was like a lion in the savanna. The passion and impulse he made her feel was strong and without restraint.\n\nApart from the four years they were separated, they had slept together for four years until now. He understood every part of her body, her preferred tension and pressure.\n\nSoon, her body reacted uncontrollably."

                      "text": "Chapter 1    \nI had thought it would be the most romantic day ever. There were two pieces of good news to celebrate today: my 3rd wedding anniversary and the fact that I'd just gotten a promotion.\nI walk eagerly to the man I love, stretching onto my toes to kiss Ryan. But he ducks, pushing something into my arms.\nWhen I unwrapped it, my whole body froze.\nA divorce document.\n\u201cThat's what I want. \u201c Ryan said coldly. His arms crossed over his chest.\u201d Honestly, I'm sick and tired of this. You're not taking care of our home. \u201d\nIt took me a minute to comprehend the current situation.\u201d It wasn't April Fool's Day. \u201d\nExasperated, Ryan rolls his angry eyes at me and gestures to the room around us. \u201c Do you know what it\u2019s like to walk into a room with cat hair everywhere and a carpet that hasn\u2019t been cleaned in months? \u201d\nMy eyes widen, my head pulling back to look at my husband. \u201cLet me remind you that I make twice as much as you do and that I am the one who pays for the cleaners. Yet, I distinctly remember conversing with you a long time ago where we agreed to take turns dividing our workload!\u201d\nThe counter-argument makes Ryan grunt, throwing his head back as he stares at the ceiling. \u201cI earn money too, Esme!\u201d He snaps at me.\n\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem here?\u201d\n\u201cThe problem? Why don\u2019t I have a housewife? You can\u2019t even be bothered to bring me a child to raise!\u201d\n\u201cMe? You do realize I want to have this baby, too, right? You\u2019re the one who refuses to go with me to the hospital! Maybe if you were a bit more active\u2014\u201d\nRyan interrupts me with a laugh that silences me.\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d He spits, seemingly implying that I\u2019m a liar. \u201cYou\u2019re having an affair with your boss; don\u2019t deny it!\u201d\nMr. Anderson? Derek Anderson? The confusion seems to proliferate, and the facial expressions that take over my face feel like a dream.\nThe only thing that is true about my boss is that he\u2019s a dashing divorced man. I\u2019m dazed at the idea my husband accuses me of sneaking behind his back.\n\u201cI can absolutely assure you, Ryan, that there never has and never will be anything regarding my boss! I am his subordinate, and there\u2019s nothing left to discuss about Mr. Anderson!\u201d\nHis arms cross over his chest again, huffing. \u201cYou\u2019re so delusional that your work has given you everything you desire when, in fact, it is your boss.\u201d\n\u201cFine. You want this divorce and to live in your fantasy world where I\u2019m the villain? I\u2019ll sign your freaking divorce papers, but not right now. For now, I\u2019m going to find a competent lawyer to help me properly divide my property from you.\u201d\nI start rushing toward the front door, needing to escape this house, this man, this absurdity.\nBut I hear Ryan chasing me down the hall. \u201cEsme! Quit stalling for more time or to conjure up new lies. If you have a clean conscience, then you should sign the papers today.\u201d\nHe grabs my arm and whirls me around, and for the first time since I met Ryan, I don\u2019t recognize the man. His eyes are dark, his skin ice cold as his fingers wrap around my upper arm, and his voice full of disgust.\nI shake my head, ripping my arm from his grasp, slap my husband in the face, and I leave the house with papers in hand and my heart bleeding on the floor in front of the man.\nHappy anniversary to me.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to murder the scum!\u201d\nMy best friends, Annie and Lily, sit at the bar on either side of me. Ransom\u2019s Tavern is our favorite place to drown our sorrows, and Lily is basically ready to go all Jeffery Dahmer on Ryan.\n\u201cAnd on your anniversary of all days! Who asks for a divorce on the day two people get married? He better be ready for me because I\u2019m going to end his entire life with one freaking punch to the face!\u201d\nI can\u2019t help but laugh at Lily as she puts up her fists like she\u2019s preparing for battle. Her nose scrunches up, and her eyebrows hide behind her brown bangs.\n\u201cCalm yourself,\u201d Annie instructs our friend.\n\u201cCalm? How can you be calm? He\u2019s just told our best friend that she\u2019s only where she is in her career because she\u2019s been sleeping with her boss! Do you know how incredibly misogynistic and disgusting that is?\u201d\n\u201cTalk louder; I don\u2019t think the entire block heard you,\u201d I reply as I take a drink. This is the last thing I need. I rub my left temple, my curly blonde hair quickly becoming tangled in my fingers.\n\u201cMoving on!\u201d Annie instructs, waving her perfectly manicured hand at Lily. Then, touching my hand on the sticky bar, Annie states seriously, \u201cEsme, if I were you, I\u2019d go to your boss\u2019 house and sleep with him. Now.\u201d\nI roll my eyes as I give the two women a sad smile. \u201cCome on, my boss isn\u2019t like you, guys. He\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s got a lot of responsibilities on his plate.\u201d\n\u201cUh, isn\u2019t your boss single now?\u201d Lily questions.\nI shrug, taking another sip of my watery beer. \u201cHe\u2019s got two daughters, and from what I\u2019ve heard, he takes care of them independently.\u201d\n\u201cAka, he\u2019s single and maybe ready to mingle?\u201d Annie teases, biting her bottom lip at her joke.\nI nudge my shoulder against hers, unable to keep a laugh from rising out of me. \u201cStop it!\u201d\nI wouldn\u2019t be shocked if Anderson is single, especially since he never works overtime. He always leaves as soon as the clock strikes five like Cinderella leaving the ball at midnight.\nBut as I sit here, I start to wonder if the booze has already saturated my mind. Because suddenly, Anderson is all I\u2019m able to think about.\nWho would it hurt if I were to maybe\u2026text him? Ryan would be furious, absolutely floored at my gall. But my anger, my desire to hurt the man who I\u2019d married three years ago, fuels my rage.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to text him,\u201d I tell the girls, pulling out my phone. I\u2019m going to tell him exactly where I am right now and use this to relieve some of the anger.\nGetting back at Ryan for his selfish and pathetic behavior? Better than giving him a swift kick in his special little place.\n\u201cNo way. Prove it!\u201d Annie smirks, looking down at my phone lying on the bar.\nI pick up the phone, typing in Anderson\u2019s name in my messages. I\u2019ll send him my address as if supposedly informing a friend of my whereabouts. Then, after about a minute, I\u2019ll just tell him I\u2019d sent the message to the wrong person.\nNo harm, no foul.\nBesides, it\u2019s already 8:45. It must be parenting time for Anderson.\nI type in the address to Ransom\u2019s Tavern and hit send. I put down the phone, my friends laughing and shoving me with disbelief.\nTo my surprise, my phone buzzes back immediately with a reply.\n\u201cFive minutes.\u201d\n\nChapter 2\n\u201cNo way, no way!\u201d Annie squeals as she grabs my phone from my hands. Her pale blue eyes sparkle with mischief. \u201cLily, he\u2019s coming!\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Lily shouts, reaching across me to take my phone next, pushing a piece of her short brown hair away from her face.\n\u201cThis is absolutely crazy. I can\u2019t even believe it! Five minutes? That\u2019s so fast!\u201d Annie cries, her arm catapulting back for the phone.\n\u201cOh my God, I\u2019m so excited, I can\u2019t wait to see what he looks like!\u201d Lily adds, jumping in her bar seat with excitement.\nThe two of them are growing louder by the second, and now I\u2019m starting to get a headache and regret my message.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you just point out that he\u2019s got two daughters? It\u2019s a school night. He\u2019s probably spending time with the kids,\u201d Lily points out as Annie re-reads the texts for the tenth time.\n\u201cWhat do you think this means?\u201d Annie asks, still staring at my phone.\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll bring them along,\u201d Lily gushes.\nI\u2019m too stunned to say anything. Did I really do this to myself? I can\u2019t even believe it!\nAs if a magic wand is waved over my head, I feel the drunkenness clears up instantly, and now I\u2019m sweating from every possible place I can think of.\n\u201cHe\u2026he must have thought I was contacting him for a work-related matter,\u201d I find myself stammering to the girls. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly dedicated.\u201d\nAnnie shakes her head. \u201cExcept this is outside of work hours, honey. Besides, he knows this is a pub, yet here he is, rushing over like your knight in shining armor!\u201d\nShe and Lily scream again, their bodies jumping up and down in the bar seats as they shake their arms in the air.\nWell, if the drunkenness has left, then bring on the hangover because I am far too sober for this.\nI\u2019m honestly speechless now. My friends must be overthinking things, surely. I mean, Anderson is just so professional in the office. He cares for his subordinates, and I know that.\nBesides, I\u2019ve never messaged him outside of the working hours in the past, so that must have made him inclined to believe it must be something serious.\nEven if that\u2019s not the case, I can\u2019t help but continue panicking in my head over the fact Anderson will be here soon.\nAs the end of the five minutes approaches, Lily and Annie decide to step aside to let me handle this situation on my own. They sit at a table in the back of the bar, watching me like I\u2019m their newest form of entertainment.\nI better come up with a perfect lie. I\u2019m starting to sweat and growing more nervous by the second for Anderson to show up. Maybe something about how work has been a struggle, or I\u2019ve had a few difficult clients?\nAs the thoughts run through my head, they\u2019re quickly sent away when Anderson walks into the bar in an elegant, perfectly tailored suit. His eyes search for me before landing on the bar, and he smiles gently.\nStanding at what I can imagine to be over six feet tall, Derek Anderson is a white yet tanned man in his late thirties with dark brown hair on his head. He has his usual dark smudges under his eyes, which match his exhaustion. He\u2019s also just about one of the most good-looking men I\u2019ve ever seen.\nI quickly scramble to my feet once he enters, realizing I have absolutely no idea what I must look like. A wreck, probably, considering I just got dumped by my own husband. Is my hair okay? What about my makeup?\nOh man, what about my breath?\nAnderson approaches, keeping his smile spread out on his face. I take a deep breath, and tell myself to calm down.\n\u201cCongratulations on your promotion, Esme,\u201d Anderson says once he\u2019s closed the distance. He looks really good tonight.\n\u201cT-Thank you,\u201d I stutter out, trying to keep my composure. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to taking on the new responsibilities.\u201d\nWe both sit at the bar together, still keeping one another in our line of sight.\nI do put a lot of time into my job, and it is genuinely rewarding and fulfilling. I mean, the years I\u2019ve put into it have given me such a rush of pride. But thinking of Ryan\u2019s complaints scratches at the surface of my skin.\n\u201cI brought you a gift to celebrate,\u201d Anderson states, holding out a small bag for me to take from him.\nSurprised, I reached out for the bag. What could he have possibly grabbed for me in the five minutes it took for him to arrive?\n\u201cThank you, Mr. Anderson, that\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d\nHe gestures to the bag. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you open it?\u201d\nI look down at the bag, feeling awkward about opening his gift right here, but do as he asks.\nI can\u2019t contain my absolute shock when I pull the gift out of the bag. A jewelry box?\nI slowly open the box, seeing a beautiful necklace inside. My jaw drops.\n\u201cW-w-what? How did you\u2014?\u201d\nAnderson gives me a sheepish smile, nodding at the box. \u201cI happened to notice your phone\u2019s wallpaper recently, and\u2026\u201d He rubs the back of his neck. \u201cI hope that it wasn\u2019t too personal.\u201d\nI can\u2019t hide my stunned expression. This is so thoughtful of Anderson, and I raise my eyes to his. How do I even thank him for this?\nThe necklace, a beautiful silver chain with a dark blue heart wrapped around it, was supposed to be a gift hint for Ryan to find. I picked it out because I knew how perfect it would match my own dark blue eyes.\nI\u2019ve been eyeing this for weeks and was so, so hopeful he would figure out my desire to own it.\nI\u2019m so confused because this is like my dream wedding anniversary! Though, in reality, it\u2019s all a mess\u2014yet here I stand with my own boss, my eyes wide and mouth agape as I hold onto the beautiful jewelry.\nThis is Anderson handing over this gift, though. Not my own husband.\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting a divorce!\u201d I blurt out without a thought.\nMy boss\u2019s expression morphs, and he gives off a strange expression. \u201cSorry?\u201d He questions.\nAt this very moment, I notice something pink on the corner of Anderson\u2019s suit. Is that\u2026Peppa Pig? A sticker?\nGod, what the heck am I doing? This is my boss! He\u2019s a mature man with children and professional conduct. A full-fledged, single father with no need for some random employee to take up his incredibly important time.\nI take one deep breath, then another. Calm down a second. This day has been such a whirlwind that I must have gotten swept up in the kind gesture from Anderson.\nMy nerves are growing, and I feel inexplicably and desperately wanting to escape this incredibly awkward situation. My personal life doesn\u2019t need to be brought up in front of Anderson, so what am I doing talking to him like we\u2019re old friends catching up?\nOut of professionalism, it\u2019s imperative that my personal matters are handled privately and have nothing to do with him. What am I even doing calling him to the bar and divulging that I\u2019m leaving Ryan behind?\nAbruptly, I make my voice sound natural, though it doesn\u2019t feel as such. \u201cWhat I meant to say was,\u201d I start, another breath to calm myself. \u201cI\u2019d like to request time off.\u201d\nAnderson raises his left eyebrow.\nI nearly cough. \u201cI need to handle the\u2026related paperwork, if that\u2019s okay, sir?\u201d\nIt feels like a bowling ball has landed on my chest as I watch his expression go unchanging. God, of all the times, to sound like a complete bumbling mess, it has to be in front of my boss.\n\nChapter 3\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d Anderson asks after the silence becomes too stuffy. He\u2019s frowning slightly, and I notice his posture slightly worsen.\nIn my head, I\u2019m thinking, What else? After all, when he arrived, he had no clue about my fight with Ryan. Does he even know today was our anniversary?\nFor some reason, as I continue to stare at the man, I feel a sense of something. Is it\u2026disappointment? Why?\nInstead of probing him with more questions, I nod my head up at the tall man. His eyes, dark and honestly somewhat mysterious, crash against my skin like a hot laser burning into me.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all, yes,\u201d I finally reply.\nI look at Anderson, and then my eyes drift over to Annie and Lily in the corner of the bar. They\u2019re watching so intensely you\u2019d think they've never seen two people interact before. I feel severe discomfort with their daggers.\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Anderson says, straightening his suit jacket. \u201cYour time off is approved. If there is anything else I can do for you, please let me know.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I say to him, wanting to give a smile but struggling to let myself give one away. He\u2019s a kind man, and I appreciate his understanding.\n\u201cOf course. Though, I have one more question, Esme.\u201d\nI turn my head to the side at the statement.\n\u201cAre you here alone tonight?\u201d Anderson\u2019s voice seems to warble a bit, and it throws me off for a moment. Did it matter if I\u2019m here by myself or not?\nNot wanting to lie but still feeling a bit nervous, I nod my head again. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d\nAnderson stands back up to depart, wiping something off of his jacket. As he does this, a waiter comes up to me and deposits a drink in front of me.\n\u201cOh, no, I didn\u2019t order\u2014\u201d I start to say, unsure where this mystery drink came from.\n\u201cCharge it double and put it on my tab,\u201d Anderson deadpans, handing over his card to the waiter, who quickly swipes it through and gives it back.\n\u201cSir, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d\nBefore I can speak, Anderson returns the card to his pocket. \u201cGoodnight, Esme. I hope your paperwork is sorted out shortly.\u201d\n\u201cBut sir, you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d I\u2019m sputtering, but he holds up his hand to stop my sentence again.\n\u201cEnjoy your night.\u201d\nAnderson then walks out of the bar alone, and I can\u2019t help but stare in disbelief at the man as he disappears behind the walls. What the heck just happened?\nThat was all so weird, and I\u2019m struggling to find any words to say now that I\u2019ve been left alone at the bar.\nIt takes another few seconds, but Annie and Lily come rushing over with bright eyes. I can tell the two are ready to start interrogating me for what happened between us, but in truth, I don\u2019t have any words for them.\nInstead, all I can do is gesture with my hands at what is before me. The necklace, the drink, and my confusion are all present.\nI want to tell them I don\u2019t know what happened, but I think my face is saying that enough. Because I don\u2019t know anything. This was all just\u2026random?\nLily, snickering to herself, mimics Anderson under her breath with her large smile. \u201cI\u2019ll pay double.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d Annie pushes, and I just shrug.\n\u201cOh, come on! He walks in here and hands you some fancy jewelry and then hands over his card without even knowing what you\u2019re drinking. That was him clearly flirting!\u201d Lily says dreamily.\n\u201cHardly,\u201d my voice croaks.\n\u201cHow many men would come into this bar and do the exact same thing, though, Esme?\u201d Annie insists. \u201cThat man just swept you off your feet!\u201d\nI look at the door where Anderson exited, wanting to ask him what is going through his head. But that\u2019s the issue. Now he\u2019s left again, and I\u2019m left wondering what this day has turned into.\nA freaking fiasco, for sure.\nLater, after finally getting Lily and Annie to let me leave the bar and return home, I climb into my empty bed.\nAlone for the first time in years, I feel helpless over my foreseeable future. It\u2019s hard to judge whether things will be good or not with Ryan already pushing and shoving his way out the door.\nWhat am I supposed to do about all of this? Today should have been perfect. Ryan could have swept me off my feet, and we could have had a romantic dinner together, shared gifts and kisses and laughter, and enjoyed ourselves. Instead, here I am, holding back tears against my pillow.\nI got a promotion, and on my wedding anniversary at the age of 30, I\u2019m about to lose my marriage. What\u2019s worse is I\u2019m still childless, which causes my heart to strain. I don\u2019t want that label. I don\u2019t want that nightmare.\nNow, I\u2019m going to be the divorced single woman everywhere I try to go.\nOr, maybe, a single, divorced career woman.\nThough, that seems to be even more stressful than the divorced woman label.\nI shake my head out on the pillow, throwing my face into the sheet. This is all happening so bloody fast that I\u2019m unsure what else to do.\nAnd on top of everything bad that\u2019s happened today, I can\u2019t stop replaying Anderson\u2019s facial expressions and kindness toward me. He\u2019s a genuinely kind individual, so having him attempt to comfort me was sympathetic.\nI can\u2019t imagine Ryan doing the same for me, even if we are still married. His compassionate side has never been his strong suit.\nThen again, maybe I\u2019ve just been wearing rose-tinted glasses the whole time, and he was never a good husband to begin with. I guess it\u2019s possible to be lost in a world of love.\nGrunting and rolling over to get out of bed, I realize that sleep shall continue to evade unless I do something about it.\nGrabbing my wallet and a light jacket to cover my pajamas, I finally exit my place, trudging downstairs and out into the world to fix this incredibly horrid headache and insomnia.\nAround the corner from my place is a 24-hour convenience store. Maybe the clinic will have the meds I\u2019m looking for. Regardless, I\u2019m so over this day, and I just want to sleep and have it be tomorrow.\nThe best way forward is through, after all.\nI shuffle into the clinic, making my way to the medication section. I tend to pick up whatever the strongest medications happen to be on the shelf.\nAt this rate, they\u2019re going to need to make a simple medication to calm my anxiety, too.\nMaybe I should go back to the doctor. My insomnia hasn\u2019t really corrupted my sleep and made me this tired in years. But clearly, I\u2019ll be struggling for the foreseeable future.\nI shuffle into the next aisle to grab a large bottle of water to take with my meds. As I get to the front of the store to pay for my supplies, I hear a voice I recognize.\n\u201cIs this the right one, you think?\u201d He asks another person nearby.\nI stretch my neck, seeing the one person I\u2019m desperately trying not to think about.\nI see the short haired blonde first, and I\u2019m surprised to see Ryan standing in the aisle just to the left of me. Then, I hear a second voice.\n\u201cMaybe we get this one,\u201d she replies.\nI narrow my eyes, and as I thank the man at the counter, I walk over to the two people.\nIt\u2019s Ryan alright, but the person he\u2019s with?\nMy cousin, Melinda. With her picture-perfect beauty and her short black hair pulled into a pathetic excuse for a ponytail, I look at the two of them down the aisle.\nAnd the object they\u2019re talking about is a freaking test stick?\n\nChapter 4\n\u201cYou really had to do this to me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Melinda complains as they pick up another stick to examine. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have used protection before you got the divorce?\u201d\n\u201cBabe, it\u2019s going to be fine because we\u2019re going to be divorced soon! Esme\u2014that freaking foolish woman\u2014she\u2019s got no idea about us! Besides, she\u2019s got significantly more savings than I do, and soon, we\u2019re going to inherit a fortune!\u201d\n\u201cYou better hope so, dummy,\u201d Melinda grunts as she turns the pink box over in her hands. \u201cThis is stressing me out.\u201d\n\u201cLook, we\u2019ll inherit the money, we\u2019ll be rich, and you and I will be together. You should get knocked up immediately, unlike Esme. She can\u2019t even have kids!\u201d\nI feel my heart turn cold, my skin burns, and my anger blinds me. This cheater! This whole time, I thought our main issue was over not having children!\nMy fingers strain around the bottles I hold, and a million different things cross my mind to screech at these two people; people I trusted!\nThis entire marriage has never hindered kids; it\u2019s only ever been for Ryan to divorce me and take my money! That spineless, pathetic scum.\n\u201cMelinda! What the heck?\u201d I screech at the two, giving away my position. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you got into bed with him!\u201d\nThe two of them turn to look at me, eyebrows raised, and, at least in my cousin\u2019s face, a slight hint of fear.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Ryan demands.\n\u201cHearing you plan your new life.\u201d I glower at my soon-to-be ex-husband. \u201cYou really think I\u2019m this foolish?\u201d\n\u201cOh no, I don\u2019t think it, I know it!\u201d Ryan retorts back.\nI look straight at my cousin, my eyes falling into slits as I speak the truth. \u201cI don\u2019t have children. No. But maybe that\u2019s because this man\u2019s got useless seeds.\u201d\nI jab a finger in Ryan\u2019s direction. \u201cI won\u2019t let you parasites take a single penny from me! This is freaking war.\u201d\nI stomp out of the pharmacy with a new purpose and officially wide awake. I\u2019m not letting this ship go down. Just the opposite: I\u2019m going to ruin their lives.\nI\u2019m getting a lawyer, gathering all the evidence, and I\u2019m taking them down every peg possible.\nBut first, I need to move out of this place. The thought of Ryan and Melinda doing it in my bed makes me want to vomit.\nI spend the night putting together what I can find, refusing to let sleep take me away from my work.\nOnce the sun comes up, I start chugging coffee, heading into the office to ask if any of my colleagues know anything about nearby rental options.\nI let myself get lost in my job and rental searches, frantic as I let the day whiz by me. It\u2019s not until I stop for a moment in the daze of anger and work that I realize two things:\nThe first one is that I told Anderson I needed time off, and I still came into the office today.\nThe second one is that it\u2019s almost five, and I have two messages from my boss asking me to come to his office when I have a moment.\n\u201cHeck!\u201d I whisper. I stand up abruptly, grab my phone, and throw it into my pocket, rushing down the hall to Anderson\u2019s office. God, this is going to look really weird, isn\u2019t it?\nI knock on the door and straighten myself out, but in my head, I know I\u2019m going to look like a mess.\n\u201cCome in,\u201d I hear Anderson call, and I slowly open the door.\n\u201cHi,\u201d I say shyly, moving forward into the room.\n\u201cAh, Esme,\u201d he smiles. He gestures at me. \u201cCome in, close the door behind you.\u201d\nOh God, am I being fired?\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, I didn\u2019t see your messages until just now. I was busy with my work.\u201d\nHe nods but tells me to sit down. \u201cNo problem, I just wanted to discuss something with you.\u201d\nThe moment my body touches the soft cushion of the chair, I\u2019m quick to explain. \u201cI completely forgot that I\u2019d asked for time off, and then I didn\u2019t even remember until I read your messages! I\u2019m so sorry for\u2014\u201d\nHe holds up a hand to stop me, and I listen, confused. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I called you in here.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d I say, shrinking into the chair. If I could just disappear into thin air right now, that\u2019d be wonderful.\n\u201cI did, however, want to ask you if you\u2019re alright. You do seem a bit\u2026tense.\u201d\nI need the power of invisibility right about now.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I lie.\n\u201cAnd the conversations around the office about you looking for rental options?\u201d\nHeck, I\u2019ve been caught.\n\u201cAre you looking for a place, Esme?\u201d He asks again.\nHe must have listened in on one of those conversations because I only spoke to a few people, and they were relatively short ones.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, really, I hope you can understand that this has been a difficult time for me. I\u2019m sorry for discussing personal matters during work hours.\u201d\nHe raises his hands to me to calm me.\n\u201cEsme, take a breath. It\u2019s fine; we have a comprehensive employee care system.\u201d Anderson gives me a deep look, seemingly looking for something. \u201cConsidering your\u2026special situation, the company has some housing allowances for employees.\u201d\nI sit up straighter. \u201cReally?\u201d\nThe man nods. \u201cYes.\u201d\nI let a long sigh out. \u201cOh, wow, okay, thank you, sir. And thank you for not telling anyone about the divorce. I haven\u2019t told anyone, and I\u2019m not exactly ready for the entire thing to go public.\u201d\nHe nods again. \u201cThat\u2019s tough, and I understand.\u201d\nI feel compelled to apologize again; this information on the housing is incredibly helpful, and I\u2019m so sleep-deprived that it actually seems like a good idea to shake his hand and give him a hug.\nGet your things together, Esme.\nHis small smile and that nod, however, make me feel a special spark ripple through me. Finally, someone understands and has given me the best encouragement I\u2019ve received yet.\nI\u2019m so grateful for his kindness, but a few tears prickle the corners of my eyes. Something about his stature and genuine concern for my well-being and home life makes me feel closer to Anderson than to my own friends.\n\u201cI appreciate the information and for everything you\u2019ve done for me, sir.\u201d\n\u201cMy best employee deserves to know that she is a valuable member to the team. If you\u2019re not in top fighting shape, then we all lose, correct?\u201d\nI nod vigorously. \u201cOf course, yes.\u201d\n\u201cVery well. Go speak to Mrs. Halloway on the third floor about your housing request, and she should be able to get everything sorted out for you today. Hurry, though, she\u2019ll be leaving any minute.\u201d\nI jump up, and without really thinking, I get moving, calling over my shoulder my appreciation once more.\nAs I rush down the stairs, I remind myself that Anderson is also divorced. He\u2019s even got two little girls to take care of. Maybe, this is a shared sympathy?\nHe must know the torture I\u2019ve been enduring since Ryan\u2019s heinous words last night. A divorce is a painful process.\nI believe, however, that my situation is guaranteed worse than anyone will know.\nI manage to catch Mrs. Halloway as she\u2019s putting her papers together to leave. She is kind enough to sit with me for twenty minutes after five as we sign papers, and I\u2019m given the keys to a new apartment to live in.\nI call Annie and Lily in hopes the two women can help me move out tonight. The sooner I\u2019m out of this place, the better.\nAs we\u2019re putting my things into boxes as quickly as possible, the girls prod me with a bunch of questions.\nClearly, everything is moving quickly to them.\n\u201cYou said this is company-provided housing?\u201d Annie asks, incredulous.\n\nChapter 5\nI smile, pushing some curly blonde hair behind my ear and out of my eyes. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d\n\u201cHow much is your rent going to cost?\u201d Lily jumps in.\nI think for a second, putting books into another box. \u201cUh, about two thousand.\u201d\nLily throws a pillow at me, pursing her red lips in my direction as she waves her arms around in the air. \u201cI\u2019m going to murder you!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I laugh, unsure what she\u2019s talking about.\n\u201cI never envied your promotion; everyone knows how hard you work. If I worked late like you, my face would collapse!\u201d\nAnnie says, \u201cBut this, I cannot forgive you for!\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I question, hands on my waist.\nThe two girls look at one another before returning their gazes to me.\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Annie replies, rolling her eyes.\n\u201cCity center,\u201d Lily ticks on her finger.\n\u201cOne thousand square meters,\u201d Annie says next.\n\u201cFully furnished apartment.\u201d\n\u201cSwimming pool, security, a gym downstairs.\u201d\n\u201cOnly 100 meters from the closest shopping center!\u201d\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to kick you out after you\u2019ve signed the contract.\u201d Lily crosses her arms with a satisfying smirk on her face.\nI roll my eyes and sigh but understand they\u2019re having fun at my expense. \u201cGirls, this is the employee care system, okay? I\u2019m getting a divorce.\u201d\nI point at Lily. \u201cAnd you? With one handsome boyfriend after another.\u201d Then, I point at the tall blonde. \u201cAnd you, with a husband that absolutely adores you! Life is fair for the two of you, and there\u2019s no need to be jealous of my pathetic life.\u201d\nI let myself fall to the ground with my legs crossed, exhausted.\nAnnie approaches me, her hand on my shoulder. \u201cWe know, hon,\u201d she reassures me.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re sorry you\u2019re going through all of this right now,\u201d Lily adds, joining us on the floor.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to keep you as happy as we can,\u201d the first woman insists. \u201cYou\u2019re our best friend, Esme, and we just want you to smile.\u201d\nI take both girls around the shoulders and hold them close, so thankful to have the two greatest friends on the planet.\n\u201cWhat the heck would I do without you two?\u201d\nLily shrugs against my embrace. \u201cYou\u2019d probably be packing this place by yourself?\u201d\nAnnie nods matter-of-factly. \u201cAlso, no one would be here to taunt you.\u201d\n\u201cOr remind you that Ryan\u2019s a loser, and you\u2019re a thousand times better off without him!\u201d\n\u201cPlus, then you\u2019d have no one to invite to your new, beautiful, stunning apartment!\u201d Annie finishes, clapping her hands together as I let them both go.\n\u201cYou two are absolutely ridiculous!\u201d I roll my eyes.\n\u201cBut you love us!\u201d They sing song together.\nIt takes only a few hours of rushed packing to get out of the house I\u2019ve lived in for the past several years. I look around one more time once the girls have left, saying goodbye to pieces of my home that will no longer be mine.\nThe perfect window perch to look out at the view around me.\nThe spot on the wooded living room floor where I\u2019d spilled just a touch of black nail polish.\nThe perfect shower and bath combo that I used to lie in for hours at a time enjoying the calm.\nThe walk-in closet is mostly barren now.\nThe steps that I\u2019d tripped down the first time I got a promotion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to say goodbye,\u201d I whisper to the house. The creaks and the shadows that I\u2019ve grown so used to will just become a faded memory. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d\nA creak in the ceiling sounds as if the home is replying to my final words.\n\u201cThank you for these past few years,\u201d I finish, standing in the middle of the living room and taking one final deep breath in.\nThen, I take off my wedding ring and place it on the kitchen table next to my house key. This is it. This is the end of my story here.\nI grab my car keys off the counter by the front door, take one more look around, and then I finally make my exit, knowing there\u2019s no chance I\u2019ll ever walk through this door again.\nI\u2019m no longer Esme, Ryan\u2019s wife.\nNow I\u2019m Esme, a strong, independent woman who is relearning the world around her.\n\u201cYou took your sweet time,\u201d Lily taunts as I finally get into my car downstairs.\n\u201cJust needed to say goodbye,\u201d I insist.\n\u201cOnly you would say goodbye to a freaking house,\u201d Annie says, poking my arm from the passenger seat. Her nails are white today, and I swat her hand away.\n\u201cLet\u2019s gooo, come on!\u201d Lily cries, holding out the second word to annoy us. She jumps up and down in the backseat. \u201cOnward to new adventures, Esme!\u201d\nThe drive to the new apartment isn\u2019t too far. It\u2019s about ten minutes away from the house, and surprisingly, it\u2019s pretty close to our favorite dive, Ransom\u2019s Tavern. That\u2019s pretty perfect since it\u2019s the middle point for all three of us.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Annie whispers as she looks out the window on her side of the car. \u201cLook how beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you said the city center, you really meant it,\u201d I reply to the two, leaning forward in my car to see the apartment building as it towers over us.\n\u201cThe name fits well, too,\u201d Lily adds, pointing out the window ahead of us. I follow her gaze as I see the plaque.\n\u201cCenter City Apartments.\u201d\n\u201cThis is nuts,\u201d I say without really thinking about it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling us,\u201d Lily huffs. \u201cHeck, Esme.\u201d\nWe get a parking spot to the elevators closest to where my unit is supposed to be, and the girls and I start planning our attack.\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s get the important stuff into the bedroom first, and then we\u2019ll grab everything else and put it in the living room,\u201d I instruct.\n\u201cGood plan,\u201d Annie nods, pulling her straight, blonde hair into a ponytail.\nWe spend about an hour just bringing things up to the apartment, moving quickly and laughing with one another about how dumb we all look doing this.\n\u201cHire movers next time!\u201d Lily grunts as she drops a box of clothes on the ground. \u201cIf I\u2019d known this was how I was spending tonight, I\u2019d have told you I was busy!\u201d\nAnnie bumps our friend as she walks by with another box of pictures and memorabilia. \u201cAt least if she hired movers, they\u2019d probably be hot!\u201d\nLily gasps. \u201cOh God, yes! They\u2019d probably be all hot and sweaty and look amazing. Instead, I stink, and I\u2019m tired and hungry!\u201d\nI throw the closest object at Lily, which just so happens to be my car keys. \u201cYou love me, and you\u2019d never leave me in the lurch.\u201d\nAnnie and Lily both shrug at the same time, and the three of us head back to the car for the final round of transferring my stuff.\nOnce we\u2019re done, the two girls decide to utilize the fully furnished couches, but I end up kicking them out so they can each go home and spend time with their men.\n\u201cCall us later if you need some talk therapy?\u201d Annie asks.\nI give her a hug. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me, I\u2019ll be sleeping for the next four days,\u201d Lily deadpans, so I shove her playfully before giving her a hug and watching the two head off together.\nI look around the apartment, not sure where to start. Maybe the best step is to be neighborly and go greet the people who live next store.\nI head out of the door and go to put my new key in my side pocket. However, I accidentally drop the metal onto the ground and crouch down to pick it up.\nSuddenly, as I\u2019m picking up the key, a little missile comes barreling toward me, and the blur crashes into my arms before falling to the ground.\nInstincts take over, and I quickly pick up the small child, an adorable little girl with dark hair. Instantly, she begins to cry as I hold her close and stand back up.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay!\u201d I tell her, bouncing her. \u201cDon\u2019t cry!\u201d\nI look around for an adult, but I\u2019m only met with another girl, a few years older than the first, who looks like a carbon copy. However, she is glaring at me.\n\u201cHow dare you make my sister cry!\u201d She shouts out. \u201cI\u2019m telling my dad on you!\u201d\nThen, as the older girl is yelling, a man in a bathrobe comes running out of the apartment next door, calling out his apologies for his daughter scaring me.\nThe first thing I see is a set of perfect abs, and I have a hard time pulling away from the sight. Wow, what a handsome set of abs.\nMy eyes move up from the abs to the eyes of the tall, tanned man. He looks incredibly relaxed and handsome as he stands in front of me, but it takes me about five seconds longer than it should to put it together.\nI can\u2019t help but gulp as I set down the girl in my arms.\nMy boss\u2026he\u2019s my neighbor?!"

                      "text": "Chapter 1    \nI had thought it would be the most romantic day ever. There were two pieces of good news to celebrate today: my 3rd wedding anniversary and the fact that I'd just gotten a promotion.\nI walk eagerly to the man I love, stretching onto my toes to kiss Ryan. But he ducks, pushing something into my arms.\nWhen I unwrapped it, my whole body froze.\nA divorce document.\n\u201cThat's what I want. \u201c Ryan said coldly. His arms crossed over his chest.\u201d Honestly, I'm sick and tired of this. You're not taking care of our home. \u201d\nIt took me a minute to comprehend the current situation.\u201d It wasn't April Fool's Day. \u201d\nExasperated, Ryan rolls his angry eyes at me and gestures to the room around us. \u201c Do you know what it\u2019s like to walk into a room with cat hair everywhere and a carpet that hasn\u2019t been cleaned in months? \u201d\nMy eyes widen, my head pulling back to look at my husband. \u201cLet me remind you that I make twice as much as you do and that I am the one who pays for the cleaners. Yet, I distinctly remember conversing with you a long time ago where we agreed to take turns dividing our workload!\u201d\nThe counter-argument makes Ryan grunt, throwing his head back as he stares at the ceiling. \u201cI earn money too, Esme!\u201d He snaps at me.\n\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem here?\u201d\n\u201cThe problem? Why don\u2019t I have a housewife? You can\u2019t even be bothered to bring me a child to raise!\u201d\n\u201cMe? You do realize I want to have this baby, too, right? You\u2019re the one who refuses to go with me to the hospital! Maybe if you were a bit more active\u2014\u201d\nRyan interrupts me with a laugh that silences me.\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d He spits, seemingly implying that I\u2019m a liar. \u201cYou\u2019re having an affair with your boss; don\u2019t deny it!\u201d\nMr. Anderson? Derek Anderson? The confusion seems to proliferate, and the facial expressions that take over my face feel like a dream.\nThe only thing that is true about my boss is that he\u2019s a dashing divorced man. I\u2019m dazed at the idea my husband accuses me of sneaking behind his back.\n\u201cI can absolutely assure you, Ryan, that there never has and never will be anything regarding my boss! I am his subordinate, and there\u2019s nothing left to discuss about Mr. Anderson!\u201d\nHis arms cross over his chest again, huffing. \u201cYou\u2019re so delusional that your work has given you everything you desire when, in fact, it is your boss.\u201d\n\u201cFine. You want this divorce and to live in your fantasy world where I\u2019m the villain? I\u2019ll sign your freaking divorce papers, but not right now. For now, I\u2019m going to find a competent lawyer to help me properly divide my property from you.\u201d\nI start rushing toward the front door, needing to escape this house, this man, this absurdity.\nBut I hear Ryan chasing me down the hall. \u201cEsme! Quit stalling for more time or to conjure up new lies. If you have a clean conscience, then you should sign the papers today.\u201d\nHe grabs my arm and whirls me around, and for the first time since I met Ryan, I don\u2019t recognize the man. His eyes are dark, his skin ice cold as his fingers wrap around my upper arm, and his voice full of disgust.\nI shake my head, ripping my arm from his grasp, slap my husband in the face, and I leave the house with papers in hand and my heart bleeding on the floor in front of the man.\nHappy anniversary to me.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to murder the scum!\u201d\nMy best friends, Annie and Lily, sit at the bar on either side of me. Ransom\u2019s Tavern is our favorite place to drown our sorrows, and Lily is basically ready to go all Jeffery Dahmer on Ryan.\n\u201cAnd on your anniversary of all days! Who asks for a divorce on the day two people get married? He better be ready for me because I\u2019m going to end his entire life with one freaking punch to the face!\u201d\nI can\u2019t help but laugh at Lily as she puts up her fists like she\u2019s preparing for battle. Her nose scrunches up, and her eyebrows hide behind her brown bangs.\n\u201cCalm yourself,\u201d Annie instructs our friend.\n\u201cCalm? How can you be calm? He\u2019s just told our best friend that she\u2019s only where she is in her career because she\u2019s been sleeping with her boss! Do you know how incredibly misogynistic and disgusting that is?\u201d\n\u201cTalk louder; I don\u2019t think the entire block heard you,\u201d I reply as I take a drink. This is the last thing I need. I rub my left temple, my curly blonde hair quickly becoming tangled in my fingers.\n\u201cMoving on!\u201d Annie instructs, waving her perfectly manicured hand at Lily. Then, touching my hand on the sticky bar, Annie states seriously, \u201cEsme, if I were you, I\u2019d go to your boss\u2019 house and sleep with him. Now.\u201d\nI roll my eyes as I give the two women a sad smile. \u201cCome on, my boss isn\u2019t like you, guys. He\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s got a lot of responsibilities on his plate.\u201d\n\u201cUh, isn\u2019t your boss single now?\u201d Lily questions.\nI shrug, taking another sip of my watery beer. \u201cHe\u2019s got two daughters, and from what I\u2019ve heard, he takes care of them independently.\u201d\n\u201cAka, he\u2019s single and maybe ready to mingle?\u201d Annie teases, biting her bottom lip at her joke.\nI nudge my shoulder against hers, unable to keep a laugh from rising out of me. \u201cStop it!\u201d\nI wouldn\u2019t be shocked if Anderson is single, especially since he never works overtime. He always leaves as soon as the clock strikes five like Cinderella leaving the ball at midnight.\nBut as I sit here, I start to wonder if the booze has already saturated my mind. Because suddenly, Anderson is all I\u2019m able to think about.\nWho would it hurt if I were to maybe\u2026text him? Ryan would be furious, absolutely floored at my gall. But my anger, my desire to hurt the man who I\u2019d married three years ago, fuels my rage.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to text him,\u201d I tell the girls, pulling out my phone. I\u2019m going to tell him exactly where I am right now and use this to relieve some of the anger.\nGetting back at Ryan for his selfish and pathetic behavior? Better than giving him a swift kick in his special little place.\n\u201cNo way. Prove it!\u201d Annie smirks, looking down at my phone lying on the bar.\nI pick up the phone, typing in Anderson\u2019s name in my messages. I\u2019ll send him my address as if supposedly informing a friend of my whereabouts. Then, after about a minute, I\u2019ll just tell him I\u2019d sent the message to the wrong person.\nNo harm, no foul.\nBesides, it\u2019s already 8:45. It must be parenting time for Anderson.\nI type in the address to Ransom\u2019s Tavern and hit send. I put down the phone, my friends laughing and shoving me with disbelief.\nTo my surprise, my phone buzzes back immediately with a reply.\n\u201cFive minutes.\u201d\n\nChapter 2\n\u201cNo way, no way!\u201d Annie squeals as she grabs my phone from my hands. Her pale blue eyes sparkle with mischief. \u201cLily, he\u2019s coming!\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Lily shouts, reaching across me to take my phone next, pushing a piece of her short brown hair away from her face.\n\u201cThis is absolutely crazy. I can\u2019t even believe it! Five minutes? That\u2019s so fast!\u201d Annie cries, her arm catapulting back for the phone.\n\u201cOh my God, I\u2019m so excited, I can\u2019t wait to see what he looks like!\u201d Lily adds, jumping in her bar seat with excitement.\nThe two of them are growing louder by the second, and now I\u2019m starting to get a headache and regret my message.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you just point out that he\u2019s got two daughters? It\u2019s a school night. He\u2019s probably spending time with the kids,\u201d Lily points out as Annie re-reads the texts for the tenth time.\n\u201cWhat do you think this means?\u201d Annie asks, still staring at my phone.\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll bring them along,\u201d Lily gushes.\nI\u2019m too stunned to say anything. Did I really do this to myself? I can\u2019t even believe it!\nAs if a magic wand is waved over my head, I feel the drunkenness clears up instantly, and now I\u2019m sweating from every possible place I can think of.\n\u201cHe\u2026he must have thought I was contacting him for a work-related matter,\u201d I find myself stammering to the girls. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly dedicated.\u201d\nAnnie shakes her head. \u201cExcept this is outside of work hours, honey. Besides, he knows this is a pub, yet here he is, rushing over like your knight in shining armor!\u201d\nShe and Lily scream again, their bodies jumping up and down in the bar seats as they shake their arms in the air.\nWell, if the drunkenness has left, then bring on the hangover because I am far too sober for this.\nI\u2019m honestly speechless now. My friends must be overthinking things, surely. I mean, Anderson is just so professional in the office. He cares for his subordinates, and I know that.\nBesides, I\u2019ve never messaged him outside of the working hours in the past, so that must have made him inclined to believe it must be something serious.\nEven if that\u2019s not the case, I can\u2019t help but continue panicking in my head over the fact Anderson will be here soon.\nAs the end of the five minutes approaches, Lily and Annie decide to step aside to let me handle this situation on my own. They sit at a table in the back of the bar, watching me like I\u2019m their newest form of entertainment.\nI better come up with a perfect lie. I\u2019m starting to sweat and growing more nervous by the second for Anderson to show up. Maybe something about how work has been a struggle, or I\u2019ve had a few difficult clients?\nAs the thoughts run through my head, they\u2019re quickly sent away when Anderson walks into the bar in an elegant, perfectly tailored suit. His eyes search for me before landing on the bar, and he smiles gently.\nStanding at what I can imagine to be over six feet tall, Derek Anderson is a white yet tanned man in his late thirties with dark brown hair on his head. He has his usual dark smudges under his eyes, which match his exhaustion. He\u2019s also just about one of the most good-looking men I\u2019ve ever seen.\nI quickly scramble to my feet once he enters, realizing I have absolutely no idea what I must look like. A wreck, probably, considering I just got dumped by my own husband. Is my hair okay? What about my makeup?\nOh man, what about my breath?\nAnderson approaches, keeping his smile spread out on his face. I take a deep breath, and tell myself to calm down.\n\u201cCongratulations on your promotion, Esme,\u201d Anderson says once he\u2019s closed the distance. He looks really good tonight.\n\u201cT-Thank you,\u201d I stutter out, trying to keep my composure. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to taking on the new responsibilities.\u201d\nWe both sit at the bar together, still keeping one another in our line of sight.\nI do put a lot of time into my job, and it is genuinely rewarding and fulfilling. I mean, the years I\u2019ve put into it have given me such a rush of pride. But thinking of Ryan\u2019s complaints scratches at the surface of my skin.\n\u201cI brought you a gift to celebrate,\u201d Anderson states, holding out a small bag for me to take from him.\nSurprised, I reached out for the bag. What could he have possibly grabbed for me in the five minutes it took for him to arrive?\n\u201cThank you, Mr. Anderson, that\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d\nHe gestures to the bag. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you open it?\u201d\nI look down at the bag, feeling awkward about opening his gift right here, but do as he asks.\nI can\u2019t contain my absolute shock when I pull the gift out of the bag. A jewelry box?\nI slowly open the box, seeing a beautiful necklace inside. My jaw drops.\n\u201cW-w-what? How did you\u2014?\u201d\nAnderson gives me a sheepish smile, nodding at the box. \u201cI happened to notice your phone\u2019s wallpaper recently, and\u2026\u201d He rubs the back of his neck. \u201cI hope that it wasn\u2019t too personal.\u201d\nI can\u2019t hide my stunned expression. This is so thoughtful of Anderson, and I raise my eyes to his. How do I even thank him for this?\nThe necklace, a beautiful silver chain with a dark blue heart wrapped around it, was supposed to be a gift hint for Ryan to find. I picked it out because I knew how perfect it would match my own dark blue eyes.\nI\u2019ve been eyeing this for weeks and was so, so hopeful he would figure out my desire to own it.\nI\u2019m so confused because this is like my dream wedding anniversary! Though, in reality, it\u2019s all a mess\u2014yet here I stand with my own boss, my eyes wide and mouth agape as I hold onto the beautiful jewelry.\nThis is Anderson handing over this gift, though. Not my own husband.\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting a divorce!\u201d I blurt out without a thought.\nMy boss\u2019s expression morphs, and he gives off a strange expression. \u201cSorry?\u201d He questions.\nAt this very moment, I notice something pink on the corner of Anderson\u2019s suit. Is that\u2026Peppa Pig? A sticker?\nGod, what the heck am I doing? This is my boss! He\u2019s a mature man with children and professional conduct. A full-fledged, single father with no need for some random employee to take up his incredibly important time.\nI take one deep breath, then another. Calm down a second. This day has been such a whirlwind that I must have gotten swept up in the kind gesture from Anderson.\nMy nerves are growing, and I feel inexplicably and desperately wanting to escape this incredibly awkward situation. My personal life doesn\u2019t need to be brought up in front of Anderson, so what am I doing talking to him like we\u2019re old friends catching up?\nOut of professionalism, it\u2019s imperative that my personal matters are handled privately and have nothing to do with him. What am I even doing calling him to the bar and divulging that I\u2019m leaving Ryan behind?\nAbruptly, I make my voice sound natural, though it doesn\u2019t feel as such. \u201cWhat I meant to say was,\u201d I start, another breath to calm myself. \u201cI\u2019d like to request time off.\u201d\nAnderson raises his left eyebrow.\nI nearly cough. \u201cI need to handle the\u2026related paperwork, if that\u2019s okay, sir?\u201d\nIt feels like a bowling ball has landed on my chest as I watch his expression go unchanging. God, of all the times, to sound like a complete bumbling mess, it has to be in front of my boss.\n\nChapter 3\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d Anderson asks after the silence becomes too stuffy. He\u2019s frowning slightly, and I notice his posture slightly worsen.\nIn my head, I\u2019m thinking, What else? After all, when he arrived, he had no clue about my fight with Ryan. Does he even know today was our anniversary?\nFor some reason, as I continue to stare at the man, I feel a sense of something. Is it\u2026disappointment? Why?\nInstead of probing him with more questions, I nod my head up at the tall man. His eyes, dark and honestly somewhat mysterious, crash against my skin like a hot laser burning into me.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all, yes,\u201d I finally reply.\nI look at Anderson, and then my eyes drift over to Annie and Lily in the corner of the bar. They\u2019re watching so intensely you\u2019d think they've never seen two people interact before. I feel severe discomfort with their daggers.\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Anderson says, straightening his suit jacket. \u201cYour time off is approved. If there is anything else I can do for you, please let me know.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I say to him, wanting to give a smile but struggling to let myself give one away. He\u2019s a kind man, and I appreciate his understanding.\n\u201cOf course. Though, I have one more question, Esme.\u201d\nI turn my head to the side at the statement.\n\u201cAre you here alone tonight?\u201d Anderson\u2019s voice seems to warble a bit, and it throws me off for a moment. Did it matter if I\u2019m here by myself or not?\nNot wanting to lie but still feeling a bit nervous, I nod my head again. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d\nAnderson stands back up to depart, wiping something off of his jacket. As he does this, a waiter comes up to me and deposits a drink in front of me.\n\u201cOh, no, I didn\u2019t order\u2014\u201d I start to say, unsure where this mystery drink came from.\n\u201cCharge it double and put it on my tab,\u201d Anderson deadpans, handing over his card to the waiter, who quickly swipes it through and gives it back.\n\u201cSir, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d\nBefore I can speak, Anderson returns the card to his pocket. \u201cGoodnight, Esme. I hope your paperwork is sorted out shortly.\u201d\n\u201cBut sir, you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d I\u2019m sputtering, but he holds up his hand to stop my sentence again.\n\u201cEnjoy your night.\u201d\nAnderson then walks out of the bar alone, and I can\u2019t help but stare in disbelief at the man as he disappears behind the walls. What the heck just happened?\nThat was all so weird, and I\u2019m struggling to find any words to say now that I\u2019ve been left alone at the bar.\nIt takes another few seconds, but Annie and Lily come rushing over with bright eyes. I can tell the two are ready to start interrogating me for what happened between us, but in truth, I don\u2019t have any words for them.\nInstead, all I can do is gesture with my hands at what is before me. The necklace, the drink, and my confusion are all present.\nI want to tell them I don\u2019t know what happened, but I think my face is saying that enough. Because I don\u2019t know anything. This was all just\u2026random?\nLily, snickering to herself, mimics Anderson under her breath with her large smile. \u201cI\u2019ll pay double.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d Annie pushes, and I just shrug.\n\u201cOh, come on! He walks in here and hands you some fancy jewelry and then hands over his card without even knowing what you\u2019re drinking. That was him clearly flirting!\u201d Lily says dreamily.\n\u201cHardly,\u201d my voice croaks.\n\u201cHow many men would come into this bar and do the exact same thing, though, Esme?\u201d Annie insists. \u201cThat man just swept you off your feet!\u201d\nI look at the door where Anderson exited, wanting to ask him what is going through his head. But that\u2019s the issue. Now he\u2019s left again, and I\u2019m left wondering what this day has turned into.\nA freaking fiasco, for sure.\nLater, after finally getting Lily and Annie to let me leave the bar and return home, I climb into my empty bed.\nAlone for the first time in years, I feel helpless over my foreseeable future. It\u2019s hard to judge whether things will be good or not with Ryan already pushing and shoving his way out the door.\nWhat am I supposed to do about all of this? Today should have been perfect. Ryan could have swept me off my feet, and we could have had a romantic dinner together, shared gifts and kisses and laughter, and enjoyed ourselves. Instead, here I am, holding back tears against my pillow.\nI got a promotion, and on my wedding anniversary at the age of 30, I\u2019m about to lose my marriage. What\u2019s worse is I\u2019m still childless, which causes my heart to strain. I don\u2019t want that label. I don\u2019t want that nightmare.\nNow, I\u2019m going to be the divorced single woman everywhere I try to go.\nOr, maybe, a single, divorced career woman.\nThough, that seems to be even more stressful than the divorced woman label.\nI shake my head out on the pillow, throwing my face into the sheet. This is all happening so bloody fast that I\u2019m unsure what else to do.\nAnd on top of everything bad that\u2019s happened today, I can\u2019t stop replaying Anderson\u2019s facial expressions and kindness toward me. He\u2019s a genuinely kind individual, so having him attempt to comfort me was sympathetic.\nI can\u2019t imagine Ryan doing the same for me, even if we are still married. His compassionate side has never been his strong suit.\nThen again, maybe I\u2019ve just been wearing rose-tinted glasses the whole time, and he was never a good husband to begin with. I guess it\u2019s possible to be lost in a world of love.\nGrunting and rolling over to get out of bed, I realize that sleep shall continue to evade unless I do something about it.\nGrabbing my wallet and a light jacket to cover my pajamas, I finally exit my place, trudging downstairs and out into the world to fix this incredibly horrid headache and insomnia.\nAround the corner from my place is a 24-hour convenience store. Maybe the clinic will have the meds I\u2019m looking for. Regardless, I\u2019m so over this day, and I just want to sleep and have it be tomorrow.\nThe best way forward is through, after all.\nI shuffle into the clinic, making my way to the medication section. I tend to pick up whatever the strongest medications happen to be on the shelf.\nAt this rate, they\u2019re going to need to make a simple medication to calm my anxiety, too.\nMaybe I should go back to the doctor. My insomnia hasn\u2019t really corrupted my sleep and made me this tired in years. But clearly, I\u2019ll be struggling for the foreseeable future.\nI shuffle into the next aisle to grab a large bottle of water to take with my meds. As I get to the front of the store to pay for my supplies, I hear a voice I recognize.\n\u201cIs this the right one, you think?\u201d He asks another person nearby.\nI stretch my neck, seeing the one person I\u2019m desperately trying not to think about.\nI see the short haired blonde first, and I\u2019m surprised to see Ryan standing in the aisle just to the left of me. Then, I hear a second voice.\n\u201cMaybe we get this one,\u201d she replies.\nI narrow my eyes, and as I thank the man at the counter, I walk over to the two people.\nIt\u2019s Ryan alright, but the person he\u2019s with?\nMy cousin, Melinda. With her picture-perfect beauty and her short black hair pulled into a pathetic excuse for a ponytail, I look at the two of them down the aisle.\nAnd the object they\u2019re talking about is a freaking test stick?\n\nChapter 4\n\u201cYou really had to do this to me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Melinda complains as they pick up another stick to examine. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have used protection before you got the divorce?\u201d\n\u201cBabe, it\u2019s going to be fine because we\u2019re going to be divorced soon! Esme\u2014that freaking foolish woman\u2014she\u2019s got no idea about us! Besides, she\u2019s got significantly more savings than I do, and soon, we\u2019re going to inherit a fortune!\u201d\n\u201cYou better hope so, dummy,\u201d Melinda grunts as she turns the pink box over in her hands. \u201cThis is stressing me out.\u201d\n\u201cLook, we\u2019ll inherit the money, we\u2019ll be rich, and you and I will be together. You should get knocked up immediately, unlike Esme. She can\u2019t even have kids!\u201d\nI feel my heart turn cold, my skin burns, and my anger blinds me. This cheater! This whole time, I thought our main issue was over not having children!\nMy fingers strain around the bottles I hold, and a million different things cross my mind to screech at these two people; people I trusted!\nThis entire marriage has never hindered kids; it\u2019s only ever been for Ryan to divorce me and take my money! That spineless, pathetic scum.\n\u201cMelinda! What the heck?\u201d I screech at the two, giving away my position. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you got into bed with him!\u201d\nThe two of them turn to look at me, eyebrows raised, and, at least in my cousin\u2019s face, a slight hint of fear.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Ryan demands.\n\u201cHearing you plan your new life.\u201d I glower at my soon-to-be ex-husband. \u201cYou really think I\u2019m this foolish?\u201d\n\u201cOh no, I don\u2019t think it, I know it!\u201d Ryan retorts back.\nI look straight at my cousin, my eyes falling into slits as I speak the truth. \u201cI don\u2019t have children. No. But maybe that\u2019s because this man\u2019s got useless seeds.\u201d\nI jab a finger in Ryan\u2019s direction. \u201cI won\u2019t let you parasites take a single penny from me! This is freaking war.\u201d\nI stomp out of the pharmacy with a new purpose and officially wide awake. I\u2019m not letting this ship go down. Just the opposite: I\u2019m going to ruin their lives.\nI\u2019m getting a lawyer, gathering all the evidence, and I\u2019m taking them down every peg possible.\nBut first, I need to move out of this place. The thought of Ryan and Melinda doing it in my bed makes me want to vomit.\nI spend the night putting together what I can find, refusing to let sleep take me away from my work.\nOnce the sun comes up, I start chugging coffee, heading into the office to ask if any of my colleagues know anything about nearby rental options.\nI let myself get lost in my job and rental searches, frantic as I let the day whiz by me. It\u2019s not until I stop for a moment in the daze of anger and work that I realize two things:\nThe first one is that I told Anderson I needed time off, and I still came into the office today.\nThe second one is that it\u2019s almost five, and I have two messages from my boss asking me to come to his office when I have a moment.\n\u201cHeck!\u201d I whisper. I stand up abruptly, grab my phone, and throw it into my pocket, rushing down the hall to Anderson\u2019s office. God, this is going to look really weird, isn\u2019t it?\nI knock on the door and straighten myself out, but in my head, I know I\u2019m going to look like a mess.\n\u201cCome in,\u201d I hear Anderson call, and I slowly open the door.\n\u201cHi,\u201d I say shyly, moving forward into the room.\n\u201cAh, Esme,\u201d he smiles. He gestures at me. \u201cCome in, close the door behind you.\u201d\nOh God, am I being fired?\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, I didn\u2019t see your messages until just now. I was busy with my work.\u201d\nHe nods but tells me to sit down. \u201cNo problem, I just wanted to discuss something with you.\u201d\nThe moment my body touches the soft cushion of the chair, I\u2019m quick to explain. \u201cI completely forgot that I\u2019d asked for time off, and then I didn\u2019t even remember until I read your messages! I\u2019m so sorry for\u2014\u201d\nHe holds up a hand to stop me, and I listen, confused. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I called you in here.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d I say, shrinking into the chair. If I could just disappear into thin air right now, that\u2019d be wonderful.\n\u201cI did, however, want to ask you if you\u2019re alright. You do seem a bit\u2026tense.\u201d\nI need the power of invisibility right about now.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I lie.\n\u201cAnd the conversations around the office about you looking for rental options?\u201d\nHeck, I\u2019ve been caught.\n\u201cAre you looking for a place, Esme?\u201d He asks again.\nHe must have listened in on one of those conversations because I only spoke to a few people, and they were relatively short ones.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, really, I hope you can understand that this has been a difficult time for me. I\u2019m sorry for discussing personal matters during work hours.\u201d\nHe raises his hands to me to calm me.\n\u201cEsme, take a breath. It\u2019s fine; we have a comprehensive employee care system.\u201d Anderson gives me a deep look, seemingly looking for something. \u201cConsidering your\u2026special situation, the company has some housing allowances for employees.\u201d\nI sit up straighter. \u201cReally?\u201d\nThe man nods. \u201cYes.\u201d\nI let a long sigh out. \u201cOh, wow, okay, thank you, sir. And thank you for not telling anyone about the divorce. I haven\u2019t told anyone, and I\u2019m not exactly ready for the entire thing to go public.\u201d\nHe nods again. \u201cThat\u2019s tough, and I understand.\u201d\nI feel compelled to apologize again; this information on the housing is incredibly helpful, and I\u2019m so sleep-deprived that it actually seems like a good idea to shake his hand and give him a hug.\nGet your things together, Esme.\nHis small smile and that nod, however, make me feel a special spark ripple through me. Finally, someone understands and has given me the best encouragement I\u2019ve received yet.\nI\u2019m so grateful for his kindness, but a few tears prickle the corners of my eyes. Something about his stature and genuine concern for my well-being and home life makes me feel closer to Anderson than to my own friends.\n\u201cI appreciate the information and for everything you\u2019ve done for me, sir.\u201d\n\u201cMy best employee deserves to know that she is a valuable member to the team. If you\u2019re not in top fighting shape, then we all lose, correct?\u201d\nI nod vigorously. \u201cOf course, yes.\u201d\n\u201cVery well. Go speak to Mrs. Halloway on the third floor about your housing request, and she should be able to get everything sorted out for you today. Hurry, though, she\u2019ll be leaving any minute.\u201d\nI jump up, and without really thinking, I get moving, calling over my shoulder my appreciation once more.\nAs I rush down the stairs, I remind myself that Anderson is also divorced. He\u2019s even got two little girls to take care of. Maybe, this is a shared sympathy?\nHe must know the torture I\u2019ve been enduring since Ryan\u2019s heinous words last night. A divorce is a painful process.\nI believe, however, that my situation is guaranteed worse than anyone will know.\nI manage to catch Mrs. Halloway as she\u2019s putting her papers together to leave. She is kind enough to sit with me for twenty minutes after five as we sign papers, and I\u2019m given the keys to a new apartment to live in.\nI call Annie and Lily in hopes the two women can help me move out tonight. The sooner I\u2019m out of this place, the better.\nAs we\u2019re putting my things into boxes as quickly as possible, the girls prod me with a bunch of questions.\nClearly, everything is moving quickly to them.\n\u201cYou said this is company-provided housing?\u201d Annie asks, incredulous.\n\nChapter 5\nI smile, pushing some curly blonde hair behind my ear and out of my eyes. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d\n\u201cHow much is your rent going to cost?\u201d Lily jumps in.\nI think for a second, putting books into another box. \u201cUh, about two thousand.\u201d\nLily throws a pillow at me, pursing her red lips in my direction as she waves her arms around in the air. \u201cI\u2019m going to murder you!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I laugh, unsure what she\u2019s talking about.\n\u201cI never envied your promotion; everyone knows how hard you work. If I worked late like you, my face would collapse!\u201d\nAnnie says, \u201cBut this, I cannot forgive you for!\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I question, hands on my waist.\nThe two girls look at one another before returning their gazes to me.\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Annie replies, rolling her eyes.\n\u201cCity center,\u201d Lily ticks on her finger.\n\u201cOne thousand square meters,\u201d Annie says next.\n\u201cFully furnished apartment.\u201d\n\u201cSwimming pool, security, a gym downstairs.\u201d\n\u201cOnly 100 meters from the closest shopping center!\u201d\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to kick you out after you\u2019ve signed the contract.\u201d Lily crosses her arms with a satisfying smirk on her face.\nI roll my eyes and sigh but understand they\u2019re having fun at my expense. \u201cGirls, this is the employee care system, okay? I\u2019m getting a divorce.\u201d\nI point at Lily. \u201cAnd you? With one handsome boyfriend after another.\u201d Then, I point at the tall blonde. \u201cAnd you, with a husband that absolutely adores you! Life is fair for the two of you, and there\u2019s no need to be jealous of my pathetic life.\u201d\nI let myself fall to the ground with my legs crossed, exhausted.\nAnnie approaches me, her hand on my shoulder. \u201cWe know, hon,\u201d she reassures me.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re sorry you\u2019re going through all of this right now,\u201d Lily adds, joining us on the floor.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to keep you as happy as we can,\u201d the first woman insists. \u201cYou\u2019re our best friend, Esme, and we just want you to smile.\u201d\nI take both girls around the shoulders and hold them close, so thankful to have the two greatest friends on the planet.\n\u201cWhat the heck would I do without you two?\u201d\nLily shrugs against my embrace. \u201cYou\u2019d probably be packing this place by yourself?\u201d\nAnnie nods matter-of-factly. \u201cAlso, no one would be here to taunt you.\u201d\n\u201cOr remind you that Ryan\u2019s a loser, and you\u2019re a thousand times better off without him!\u201d\n\u201cPlus, then you\u2019d have no one to invite to your new, beautiful, stunning apartment!\u201d Annie finishes, clapping her hands together as I let them both go.\n\u201cYou two are absolutely ridiculous!\u201d I roll my eyes.\n\u201cBut you love us!\u201d They sing song together.\nIt takes only a few hours of rushed packing to get out of the house I\u2019ve lived in for the past several years. I look around one more time once the girls have left, saying goodbye to pieces of my home that will no longer be mine.\nThe perfect window perch to look out at the view around me.\nThe spot on the wooded living room floor where I\u2019d spilled just a touch of black nail polish.\nThe perfect shower and bath combo that I used to lie in for hours at a time enjoying the calm.\nThe walk-in closet is mostly barren now.\nThe steps that I\u2019d tripped down the first time I got a promotion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to say goodbye,\u201d I whisper to the house. The creaks and the shadows that I\u2019ve grown so used to will just become a faded memory. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d\nA creak in the ceiling sounds as if the home is replying to my final words.\n\u201cThank you for these past few years,\u201d I finish, standing in the middle of the living room and taking one final deep breath in.\nThen, I take off my wedding ring and place it on the kitchen table next to my house key. This is it. This is the end of my story here.\nI grab my car keys off the counter by the front door, take one more look around, and then I finally make my exit, knowing there\u2019s no chance I\u2019ll ever walk through this door again.\nI\u2019m no longer Esme, Ryan\u2019s wife.\nNow I\u2019m Esme, a strong, independent woman who is relearning the world around her.\n\u201cYou took your sweet time,\u201d Lily taunts as I finally get into my car downstairs.\n\u201cJust needed to say goodbye,\u201d I insist.\n\u201cOnly you would say goodbye to a freaking house,\u201d Annie says, poking my arm from the passenger seat. Her nails are white today, and I swat her hand away.\n\u201cLet\u2019s gooo, come on!\u201d Lily cries, holding out the second word to annoy us. She jumps up and down in the backseat. \u201cOnward to new adventures, Esme!\u201d\nThe drive to the new apartment isn\u2019t too far. It\u2019s about ten minutes away from the house, and surprisingly, it\u2019s pretty close to our favorite dive, Ransom\u2019s Tavern. That\u2019s pretty perfect since it\u2019s the middle point for all three of us.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Annie whispers as she looks out the window on her side of the car. \u201cLook how beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you said the city center, you really meant it,\u201d I reply to the two, leaning forward in my car to see the apartment building as it towers over us.\n\u201cThe name fits well, too,\u201d Lily adds, pointing out the window ahead of us. I follow her gaze as I see the plaque.\n\u201cCenter City Apartments.\u201d\n\u201cThis is nuts,\u201d I say without really thinking about it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling us,\u201d Lily huffs. \u201cHeck, Esme.\u201d\nWe get a parking spot to the elevators closest to where my unit is supposed to be, and the girls and I start planning our attack.\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s get the important stuff into the bedroom first, and then we\u2019ll grab everything else and put it in the living room,\u201d I instruct.\n\u201cGood plan,\u201d Annie nods, pulling her straight, blonde hair into a ponytail.\nWe spend about an hour just bringing things up to the apartment, moving quickly and laughing with one another about how dumb we all look doing this.\n\u201cHire movers next time!\u201d Lily grunts as she drops a box of clothes on the ground. \u201cIf I\u2019d known this was how I was spending tonight, I\u2019d have told you I was busy!\u201d\nAnnie bumps our friend as she walks by with another box of pictures and memorabilia. \u201cAt least if she hired movers, they\u2019d probably be hot!\u201d\nLily gasps. \u201cOh God, yes! They\u2019d probably be all hot and sweaty and look amazing. Instead, I stink, and I\u2019m tired and hungry!\u201d\nI throw the closest object at Lily, which just so happens to be my car keys. \u201cYou love me, and you\u2019d never leave me in the lurch.\u201d\nAnnie and Lily both shrug at the same time, and the three of us head back to the car for the final round of transferring my stuff.\nOnce we\u2019re done, the two girls decide to utilize the fully furnished couches, but I end up kicking them out so they can each go home and spend time with their men.\n\u201cCall us later if you need some talk therapy?\u201d Annie asks.\nI give her a hug. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me, I\u2019ll be sleeping for the next four days,\u201d Lily deadpans, so I shove her playfully before giving her a hug and watching the two head off together.\nI look around the apartment, not sure where to start. Maybe the best step is to be neighborly and go greet the people who live next store.\nI head out of the door and go to put my new key in my side pocket. However, I accidentally drop the metal onto the ground and crouch down to pick it up.\nSuddenly, as I\u2019m picking up the key, a little missile comes barreling toward me, and the blur crashes into my arms before falling to the ground.\nInstincts take over, and I quickly pick up the small child, an adorable little girl with dark hair. Instantly, she begins to cry as I hold her close and stand back up.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay!\u201d I tell her, bouncing her. \u201cDon\u2019t cry!\u201d\nI look around for an adult, but I\u2019m only met with another girl, a few years older than the first, who looks like a carbon copy. However, she is glaring at me.\n\u201cHow dare you make my sister cry!\u201d She shouts out. \u201cI\u2019m telling my dad on you!\u201d\nThen, as the older girl is yelling, a man in a bathrobe comes running out of the apartment next door, calling out his apologies for his daughter scaring me.\nThe first thing I see is a set of perfect abs, and I have a hard time pulling away from the sight. Wow, what a handsome set of abs.\nMy eyes move up from the abs to the eyes of the tall, tanned man. He looks incredibly relaxed and handsome as he stands in front of me, but it takes me about five seconds longer than it should to put it together.\nI can\u2019t help but gulp as I set down the girl in my arms.\nMy boss\u2026he\u2019s my neighbor?!"

                      "text": "Chapter 1    \nI had thought it would be the most romantic day ever. There were two pieces of good news to celebrate today: my 3rd wedding anniversary and the fact that I'd just gotten a promotion.\nI walk eagerly to the man I love, stretching onto my toes to kiss Ryan. But he ducks, pushing something into my arms.\nWhen I unwrapped it, my whole body froze.\nA divorce document.\n\u201cThat's what I want. \u201c Ryan said coldly. His arms crossed over his chest.\u201d Honestly, I'm sick and tired of this. You're not taking care of our home. \u201d\nIt took me a minute to comprehend the current situation.\u201d It wasn't April Fool's Day. \u201d\nExasperated, Ryan rolls his angry eyes at me and gestures to the room around us. \u201c Do you know what it\u2019s like to walk into a room with cat hair everywhere and a carpet that hasn\u2019t been cleaned in months? \u201d\nMy eyes widen, my head pulling back to look at my husband. \u201cLet me remind you that I make twice as much as you do and that I am the one who pays for the cleaners. Yet, I distinctly remember conversing with you a long time ago where we agreed to take turns dividing our workload!\u201d\nThe counter-argument makes Ryan grunt, throwing his head back as he stares at the ceiling. \u201cI earn money too, Esme!\u201d He snaps at me.\n\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem here?\u201d\n\u201cThe problem? Why don\u2019t I have a housewife? You can\u2019t even be bothered to bring me a child to raise!\u201d\n\u201cMe? You do realize I want to have this baby, too, right? You\u2019re the one who refuses to go with me to the hospital! Maybe if you were a bit more active\u2014\u201d\nRyan interrupts me with a laugh that silences me.\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d He spits, seemingly implying that I\u2019m a liar. \u201cYou\u2019re having an affair with your boss; don\u2019t deny it!\u201d\nMr. Anderson? Derek Anderson? The confusion seems to proliferate, and the facial expressions that take over my face feel like a dream.\nThe only thing that is true about my boss is that he\u2019s a dashing divorced man. I\u2019m dazed at the idea my husband accuses me of sneaking behind his back.\n\u201cI can absolutely assure you, Ryan, that there never has and never will be anything regarding my boss! I am his subordinate, and there\u2019s nothing left to discuss about Mr. Anderson!\u201d\nHis arms cross over his chest again, huffing. \u201cYou\u2019re so delusional that your work has given you everything you desire when, in fact, it is your boss.\u201d\n\u201cFine. You want this divorce and to live in your fantasy world where I\u2019m the villain? I\u2019ll sign your freaking divorce papers, but not right now. For now, I\u2019m going to find a competent lawyer to help me properly divide my property from you.\u201d\nI start rushing toward the front door, needing to escape this house, this man, this absurdity.\nBut I hear Ryan chasing me down the hall. \u201cEsme! Quit stalling for more time or to conjure up new lies. If you have a clean conscience, then you should sign the papers today.\u201d\nHe grabs my arm and whirls me around, and for the first time since I met Ryan, I don\u2019t recognize the man. His eyes are dark, his skin ice cold as his fingers wrap around my upper arm, and his voice full of disgust.\nI shake my head, ripping my arm from his grasp, slap my husband in the face, and I leave the house with papers in hand and my heart bleeding on the floor in front of the man.\nHappy anniversary to me.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to murder the scum!\u201d\nMy best friends, Annie and Lily, sit at the bar on either side of me. Ransom\u2019s Tavern is our favorite place to drown our sorrows, and Lily is basically ready to go all Jeffery Dahmer on Ryan.\n\u201cAnd on your anniversary of all days! Who asks for a divorce on the day two people get married? He better be ready for me because I\u2019m going to end his entire life with one freaking punch to the face!\u201d\nI can\u2019t help but laugh at Lily as she puts up her fists like she\u2019s preparing for battle. Her nose scrunches up, and her eyebrows hide behind her brown bangs.\n\u201cCalm yourself,\u201d Annie instructs our friend.\n\u201cCalm? How can you be calm? He\u2019s just told our best friend that she\u2019s only where she is in her career because she\u2019s been sleeping with her boss! Do you know how incredibly misogynistic and disgusting that is?\u201d\n\u201cTalk louder; I don\u2019t think the entire block heard you,\u201d I reply as I take a drink. This is the last thing I need. I rub my left temple, my curly blonde hair quickly becoming tangled in my fingers.\n\u201cMoving on!\u201d Annie instructs, waving her perfectly manicured hand at Lily. Then, touching my hand on the sticky bar, Annie states seriously, \u201cEsme, if I were you, I\u2019d go to your boss\u2019 house and sleep with him. Now.\u201d\nI roll my eyes as I give the two women a sad smile. \u201cCome on, my boss isn\u2019t like you, guys. He\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s got a lot of responsibilities on his plate.\u201d\n\u201cUh, isn\u2019t your boss single now?\u201d Lily questions.\nI shrug, taking another sip of my watery beer. \u201cHe\u2019s got two daughters, and from what I\u2019ve heard, he takes care of them independently.\u201d\n\u201cAka, he\u2019s single and maybe ready to mingle?\u201d Annie teases, biting her bottom lip at her joke.\nI nudge my shoulder against hers, unable to keep a laugh from rising out of me. \u201cStop it!\u201d\nI wouldn\u2019t be shocked if Anderson is single, especially since he never works overtime. He always leaves as soon as the clock strikes five like Cinderella leaving the ball at midnight.\nBut as I sit here, I start to wonder if the booze has already saturated my mind. Because suddenly, Anderson is all I\u2019m able to think about.\nWho would it hurt if I were to maybe\u2026text him? Ryan would be furious, absolutely floored at my gall. But my anger, my desire to hurt the man who I\u2019d married three years ago, fuels my rage.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to text him,\u201d I tell the girls, pulling out my phone. I\u2019m going to tell him exactly where I am right now and use this to relieve some of the anger.\nGetting back at Ryan for his selfish and pathetic behavior? Better than giving him a swift kick in his special little place.\n\u201cNo way. Prove it!\u201d Annie smirks, looking down at my phone lying on the bar.\nI pick up the phone, typing in Anderson\u2019s name in my messages. I\u2019ll send him my address as if supposedly informing a friend of my whereabouts. Then, after about a minute, I\u2019ll just tell him I\u2019d sent the message to the wrong person.\nNo harm, no foul.\nBesides, it\u2019s already 8:45. It must be parenting time for Anderson.\nI type in the address to Ransom\u2019s Tavern and hit send. I put down the phone, my friends laughing and shoving me with disbelief.\nTo my surprise, my phone buzzes back immediately with a reply.\n\u201cFive minutes.\u201d\n\nChapter 2\n\u201cNo way, no way!\u201d Annie squeals as she grabs my phone from my hands. Her pale blue eyes sparkle with mischief. \u201cLily, he\u2019s coming!\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Lily shouts, reaching across me to take my phone next, pushing a piece of her short brown hair away from her face.\n\u201cThis is absolutely crazy. I can\u2019t even believe it! Five minutes? That\u2019s so fast!\u201d Annie cries, her arm catapulting back for the phone.\n\u201cOh my God, I\u2019m so excited, I can\u2019t wait to see what he looks like!\u201d Lily adds, jumping in her bar seat with excitement.\nThe two of them are growing louder by the second, and now I\u2019m starting to get a headache and regret my message.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you just point out that he\u2019s got two daughters? It\u2019s a school night. He\u2019s probably spending time with the kids,\u201d Lily points out as Annie re-reads the texts for the tenth time.\n\u201cWhat do you think this means?\u201d Annie asks, still staring at my phone.\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll bring them along,\u201d Lily gushes.\nI\u2019m too stunned to say anything. Did I really do this to myself? I can\u2019t even believe it!\nAs if a magic wand is waved over my head, I feel the drunkenness clears up instantly, and now I\u2019m sweating from every possible place I can think of.\n\u201cHe\u2026he must have thought I was contacting him for a work-related matter,\u201d I find myself stammering to the girls. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly dedicated.\u201d\nAnnie shakes her head. \u201cExcept this is outside of work hours, honey. Besides, he knows this is a pub, yet here he is, rushing over like your knight in shining armor!\u201d\nShe and Lily scream again, their bodies jumping up and down in the bar seats as they shake their arms in the air.\nWell, if the drunkenness has left, then bring on the hangover because I am far too sober for this.\nI\u2019m honestly speechless now. My friends must be overthinking things, surely. I mean, Anderson is just so professional in the office. He cares for his subordinates, and I know that.\nBesides, I\u2019ve never messaged him outside of the working hours in the past, so that must have made him inclined to believe it must be something serious.\nEven if that\u2019s not the case, I can\u2019t help but continue panicking in my head over the fact Anderson will be here soon.\nAs the end of the five minutes approaches, Lily and Annie decide to step aside to let me handle this situation on my own. They sit at a table in the back of the bar, watching me like I\u2019m their newest form of entertainment.\nI better come up with a perfect lie. I\u2019m starting to sweat and growing more nervous by the second for Anderson to show up. Maybe something about how work has been a struggle, or I\u2019ve had a few difficult clients?\nAs the thoughts run through my head, they\u2019re quickly sent away when Anderson walks into the bar in an elegant, perfectly tailored suit. His eyes search for me before landing on the bar, and he smiles gently.\nStanding at what I can imagine to be over six feet tall, Derek Anderson is a white yet tanned man in his late thirties with dark brown hair on his head. He has his usual dark smudges under his eyes, which match his exhaustion. He\u2019s also just about one of the most good-looking men I\u2019ve ever seen.\nI quickly scramble to my feet once he enters, realizing I have absolutely no idea what I must look like. A wreck, probably, considering I just got dumped by my own husband. Is my hair okay? What about my makeup?\nOh man, what about my breath?\nAnderson approaches, keeping his smile spread out on his face. I take a deep breath, and tell myself to calm down.\n\u201cCongratulations on your promotion, Esme,\u201d Anderson says once he\u2019s closed the distance. He looks really good tonight.\n\u201cT-Thank you,\u201d I stutter out, trying to keep my composure. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to taking on the new responsibilities.\u201d\nWe both sit at the bar together, still keeping one another in our line of sight.\nI do put a lot of time into my job, and it is genuinely rewarding and fulfilling. I mean, the years I\u2019ve put into it have given me such a rush of pride. But thinking of Ryan\u2019s complaints scratches at the surface of my skin.\n\u201cI brought you a gift to celebrate,\u201d Anderson states, holding out a small bag for me to take from him.\nSurprised, I reached out for the bag. What could he have possibly grabbed for me in the five minutes it took for him to arrive?\n\u201cThank you, Mr. Anderson, that\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d\nHe gestures to the bag. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you open it?\u201d\nI look down at the bag, feeling awkward about opening his gift right here, but do as he asks.\nI can\u2019t contain my absolute shock when I pull the gift out of the bag. A jewelry box?\nI slowly open the box, seeing a beautiful necklace inside. My jaw drops.\n\u201cW-w-what? How did you\u2014?\u201d\nAnderson gives me a sheepish smile, nodding at the box. \u201cI happened to notice your phone\u2019s wallpaper recently, and\u2026\u201d He rubs the back of his neck. \u201cI hope that it wasn\u2019t too personal.\u201d\nI can\u2019t hide my stunned expression. This is so thoughtful of Anderson, and I raise my eyes to his. How do I even thank him for this?\nThe necklace, a beautiful silver chain with a dark blue heart wrapped around it, was supposed to be a gift hint for Ryan to find. I picked it out because I knew how perfect it would match my own dark blue eyes.\nI\u2019ve been eyeing this for weeks and was so, so hopeful he would figure out my desire to own it.\nI\u2019m so confused because this is like my dream wedding anniversary! Though, in reality, it\u2019s all a mess\u2014yet here I stand with my own boss, my eyes wide and mouth agape as I hold onto the beautiful jewelry.\nThis is Anderson handing over this gift, though. Not my own husband.\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting a divorce!\u201d I blurt out without a thought.\nMy boss\u2019s expression morphs, and he gives off a strange expression. \u201cSorry?\u201d He questions.\nAt this very moment, I notice something pink on the corner of Anderson\u2019s suit. Is that\u2026Peppa Pig? A sticker?\nGod, what the heck am I doing? This is my boss! He\u2019s a mature man with children and professional conduct. A full-fledged, single father with no need for some random employee to take up his incredibly important time.\nI take one deep breath, then another. Calm down a second. This day has been such a whirlwind that I must have gotten swept up in the kind gesture from Anderson.\nMy nerves are growing, and I feel inexplicably and desperately wanting to escape this incredibly awkward situation. My personal life doesn\u2019t need to be brought up in front of Anderson, so what am I doing talking to him like we\u2019re old friends catching up?\nOut of professionalism, it\u2019s imperative that my personal matters are handled privately and have nothing to do with him. What am I even doing calling him to the bar and divulging that I\u2019m leaving Ryan behind?\nAbruptly, I make my voice sound natural, though it doesn\u2019t feel as such. \u201cWhat I meant to say was,\u201d I start, another breath to calm myself. \u201cI\u2019d like to request time off.\u201d\nAnderson raises his left eyebrow.\nI nearly cough. \u201cI need to handle the\u2026related paperwork, if that\u2019s okay, sir?\u201d\nIt feels like a bowling ball has landed on my chest as I watch his expression go unchanging. God, of all the times, to sound like a complete bumbling mess, it has to be in front of my boss.\n\nChapter 3\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d Anderson asks after the silence becomes too stuffy. He\u2019s frowning slightly, and I notice his posture slightly worsen.\nIn my head, I\u2019m thinking, What else? After all, when he arrived, he had no clue about my fight with Ryan. Does he even know today was our anniversary?\nFor some reason, as I continue to stare at the man, I feel a sense of something. Is it\u2026disappointment? Why?\nInstead of probing him with more questions, I nod my head up at the tall man. His eyes, dark and honestly somewhat mysterious, crash against my skin like a hot laser burning into me.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all, yes,\u201d I finally reply.\nI look at Anderson, and then my eyes drift over to Annie and Lily in the corner of the bar. They\u2019re watching so intensely you\u2019d think they've never seen two people interact before. I feel severe discomfort with their daggers.\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Anderson says, straightening his suit jacket. \u201cYour time off is approved. If there is anything else I can do for you, please let me know.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I say to him, wanting to give a smile but struggling to let myself give one away. He\u2019s a kind man, and I appreciate his understanding.\n\u201cOf course. Though, I have one more question, Esme.\u201d\nI turn my head to the side at the statement.\n\u201cAre you here alone tonight?\u201d Anderson\u2019s voice seems to warble a bit, and it throws me off for a moment. Did it matter if I\u2019m here by myself or not?\nNot wanting to lie but still feeling a bit nervous, I nod my head again. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d\nAnderson stands back up to depart, wiping something off of his jacket. As he does this, a waiter comes up to me and deposits a drink in front of me.\n\u201cOh, no, I didn\u2019t order\u2014\u201d I start to say, unsure where this mystery drink came from.\n\u201cCharge it double and put it on my tab,\u201d Anderson deadpans, handing over his card to the waiter, who quickly swipes it through and gives it back.\n\u201cSir, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d\nBefore I can speak, Anderson returns the card to his pocket. \u201cGoodnight, Esme. I hope your paperwork is sorted out shortly.\u201d\n\u201cBut sir, you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d I\u2019m sputtering, but he holds up his hand to stop my sentence again.\n\u201cEnjoy your night.\u201d\nAnderson then walks out of the bar alone, and I can\u2019t help but stare in disbelief at the man as he disappears behind the walls. What the heck just happened?\nThat was all so weird, and I\u2019m struggling to find any words to say now that I\u2019ve been left alone at the bar.\nIt takes another few seconds, but Annie and Lily come rushing over with bright eyes. I can tell the two are ready to start interrogating me for what happened between us, but in truth, I don\u2019t have any words for them.\nInstead, all I can do is gesture with my hands at what is before me. The necklace, the drink, and my confusion are all present.\nI want to tell them I don\u2019t know what happened, but I think my face is saying that enough. Because I don\u2019t know anything. This was all just\u2026random?\nLily, snickering to herself, mimics Anderson under her breath with her large smile. \u201cI\u2019ll pay double.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d Annie pushes, and I just shrug.\n\u201cOh, come on! He walks in here and hands you some fancy jewelry and then hands over his card without even knowing what you\u2019re drinking. That was him clearly flirting!\u201d Lily says dreamily.\n\u201cHardly,\u201d my voice croaks.\n\u201cHow many men would come into this bar and do the exact same thing, though, Esme?\u201d Annie insists. \u201cThat man just swept you off your feet!\u201d\nI look at the door where Anderson exited, wanting to ask him what is going through his head. But that\u2019s the issue. Now he\u2019s left again, and I\u2019m left wondering what this day has turned into.\nA freaking fiasco, for sure.\nLater, after finally getting Lily and Annie to let me leave the bar and return home, I climb into my empty bed.\nAlone for the first time in years, I feel helpless over my foreseeable future. It\u2019s hard to judge whether things will be good or not with Ryan already pushing and shoving his way out the door.\nWhat am I supposed to do about all of this? Today should have been perfect. Ryan could have swept me off my feet, and we could have had a romantic dinner together, shared gifts and kisses and laughter, and enjoyed ourselves. Instead, here I am, holding back tears against my pillow.\nI got a promotion, and on my wedding anniversary at the age of 30, I\u2019m about to lose my marriage. What\u2019s worse is I\u2019m still childless, which causes my heart to strain. I don\u2019t want that label. I don\u2019t want that nightmare.\nNow, I\u2019m going to be the divorced single woman everywhere I try to go.\nOr, maybe, a single, divorced career woman.\nThough, that seems to be even more stressful than the divorced woman label.\nI shake my head out on the pillow, throwing my face into the sheet. This is all happening so bloody fast that I\u2019m unsure what else to do.\nAnd on top of everything bad that\u2019s happened today, I can\u2019t stop replaying Anderson\u2019s facial expressions and kindness toward me. He\u2019s a genuinely kind individual, so having him attempt to comfort me was sympathetic.\nI can\u2019t imagine Ryan doing the same for me, even if we are still married. His compassionate side has never been his strong suit.\nThen again, maybe I\u2019ve just been wearing rose-tinted glasses the whole time, and he was never a good husband to begin with. I guess it\u2019s possible to be lost in a world of love.\nGrunting and rolling over to get out of bed, I realize that sleep shall continue to evade unless I do something about it.\nGrabbing my wallet and a light jacket to cover my pajamas, I finally exit my place, trudging downstairs and out into the world to fix this incredibly horrid headache and insomnia.\nAround the corner from my place is a 24-hour convenience store. Maybe the clinic will have the meds I\u2019m looking for. Regardless, I\u2019m so over this day, and I just want to sleep and have it be tomorrow.\nThe best way forward is through, after all.\nI shuffle into the clinic, making my way to the medication section. I tend to pick up whatever the strongest medications happen to be on the shelf.\nAt this rate, they\u2019re going to need to make a simple medication to calm my anxiety, too.\nMaybe I should go back to the doctor. My insomnia hasn\u2019t really corrupted my sleep and made me this tired in years. But clearly, I\u2019ll be struggling for the foreseeable future.\nI shuffle into the next aisle to grab a large bottle of water to take with my meds. As I get to the front of the store to pay for my supplies, I hear a voice I recognize.\n\u201cIs this the right one, you think?\u201d He asks another person nearby.\nI stretch my neck, seeing the one person I\u2019m desperately trying not to think about.\nI see the short haired blonde first, and I\u2019m surprised to see Ryan standing in the aisle just to the left of me. Then, I hear a second voice.\n\u201cMaybe we get this one,\u201d she replies.\nI narrow my eyes, and as I thank the man at the counter, I walk over to the two people.\nIt\u2019s Ryan alright, but the person he\u2019s with?\nMy cousin, Melinda. With her picture-perfect beauty and her short black hair pulled into a pathetic excuse for a ponytail, I look at the two of them down the aisle.\nAnd the object they\u2019re talking about is a freaking test stick?\n\nChapter 4\n\u201cYou really had to do this to me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Melinda complains as they pick up another stick to examine. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have used protection before you got the divorce?\u201d\n\u201cBabe, it\u2019s going to be fine because we\u2019re going to be divorced soon! Esme\u2014that freaking foolish woman\u2014she\u2019s got no idea about us! Besides, she\u2019s got significantly more savings than I do, and soon, we\u2019re going to inherit a fortune!\u201d\n\u201cYou better hope so, dummy,\u201d Melinda grunts as she turns the pink box over in her hands. \u201cThis is stressing me out.\u201d\n\u201cLook, we\u2019ll inherit the money, we\u2019ll be rich, and you and I will be together. You should get knocked up immediately, unlike Esme. She can\u2019t even have kids!\u201d\nI feel my heart turn cold, my skin burns, and my anger blinds me. This cheater! This whole time, I thought our main issue was over not having children!\nMy fingers strain around the bottles I hold, and a million different things cross my mind to screech at these two people; people I trusted!\nThis entire marriage has never hindered kids; it\u2019s only ever been for Ryan to divorce me and take my money! That spineless, pathetic scum.\n\u201cMelinda! What the heck?\u201d I screech at the two, giving away my position. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you got into bed with him!\u201d\nThe two of them turn to look at me, eyebrows raised, and, at least in my cousin\u2019s face, a slight hint of fear.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Ryan demands.\n\u201cHearing you plan your new life.\u201d I glower at my soon-to-be ex-husband. \u201cYou really think I\u2019m this foolish?\u201d\n\u201cOh no, I don\u2019t think it, I know it!\u201d Ryan retorts back.\nI look straight at my cousin, my eyes falling into slits as I speak the truth. \u201cI don\u2019t have children. No. But maybe that\u2019s because this man\u2019s got useless seeds.\u201d\nI jab a finger in Ryan\u2019s direction. \u201cI won\u2019t let you parasites take a single penny from me! This is freaking war.\u201d\nI stomp out of the pharmacy with a new purpose and officially wide awake. I\u2019m not letting this ship go down. Just the opposite: I\u2019m going to ruin their lives.\nI\u2019m getting a lawyer, gathering all the evidence, and I\u2019m taking them down every peg possible.\nBut first, I need to move out of this place. The thought of Ryan and Melinda doing it in my bed makes me want to vomit.\nI spend the night putting together what I can find, refusing to let sleep take me away from my work.\nOnce the sun comes up, I start chugging coffee, heading into the office to ask if any of my colleagues know anything about nearby rental options.\nI let myself get lost in my job and rental searches, frantic as I let the day whiz by me. It\u2019s not until I stop for a moment in the daze of anger and work that I realize two things:\nThe first one is that I told Anderson I needed time off, and I still came into the office today.\nThe second one is that it\u2019s almost five, and I have two messages from my boss asking me to come to his office when I have a moment.\n\u201cHeck!\u201d I whisper. I stand up abruptly, grab my phone, and throw it into my pocket, rushing down the hall to Anderson\u2019s office. God, this is going to look really weird, isn\u2019t it?\nI knock on the door and straighten myself out, but in my head, I know I\u2019m going to look like a mess.\n\u201cCome in,\u201d I hear Anderson call, and I slowly open the door.\n\u201cHi,\u201d I say shyly, moving forward into the room.\n\u201cAh, Esme,\u201d he smiles. He gestures at me. \u201cCome in, close the door behind you.\u201d\nOh God, am I being fired?\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, I didn\u2019t see your messages until just now. I was busy with my work.\u201d\nHe nods but tells me to sit down. \u201cNo problem, I just wanted to discuss something with you.\u201d\nThe moment my body touches the soft cushion of the chair, I\u2019m quick to explain. \u201cI completely forgot that I\u2019d asked for time off, and then I didn\u2019t even remember until I read your messages! I\u2019m so sorry for\u2014\u201d\nHe holds up a hand to stop me, and I listen, confused. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I called you in here.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d I say, shrinking into the chair. If I could just disappear into thin air right now, that\u2019d be wonderful.\n\u201cI did, however, want to ask you if you\u2019re alright. You do seem a bit\u2026tense.\u201d\nI need the power of invisibility right about now.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I lie.\n\u201cAnd the conversations around the office about you looking for rental options?\u201d\nHeck, I\u2019ve been caught.\n\u201cAre you looking for a place, Esme?\u201d He asks again.\nHe must have listened in on one of those conversations because I only spoke to a few people, and they were relatively short ones.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, really, I hope you can understand that this has been a difficult time for me. I\u2019m sorry for discussing personal matters during work hours.\u201d\nHe raises his hands to me to calm me.\n\u201cEsme, take a breath. It\u2019s fine; we have a comprehensive employee care system.\u201d Anderson gives me a deep look, seemingly looking for something. \u201cConsidering your\u2026special situation, the company has some housing allowances for employees.\u201d\nI sit up straighter. \u201cReally?\u201d\nThe man nods. \u201cYes.\u201d\nI let a long sigh out. \u201cOh, wow, okay, thank you, sir. And thank you for not telling anyone about the divorce. I haven\u2019t told anyone, and I\u2019m not exactly ready for the entire thing to go public.\u201d\nHe nods again. \u201cThat\u2019s tough, and I understand.\u201d\nI feel compelled to apologize again; this information on the housing is incredibly helpful, and I\u2019m so sleep-deprived that it actually seems like a good idea to shake his hand and give him a hug.\nGet your things together, Esme.\nHis small smile and that nod, however, make me feel a special spark ripple through me. Finally, someone understands and has given me the best encouragement I\u2019ve received yet.\nI\u2019m so grateful for his kindness, but a few tears prickle the corners of my eyes. Something about his stature and genuine concern for my well-being and home life makes me feel closer to Anderson than to my own friends.\n\u201cI appreciate the information and for everything you\u2019ve done for me, sir.\u201d\n\u201cMy best employee deserves to know that she is a valuable member to the team. If you\u2019re not in top fighting shape, then we all lose, correct?\u201d\nI nod vigorously. \u201cOf course, yes.\u201d\n\u201cVery well. Go speak to Mrs. Halloway on the third floor about your housing request, and she should be able to get everything sorted out for you today. Hurry, though, she\u2019ll be leaving any minute.\u201d\nI jump up, and without really thinking, I get moving, calling over my shoulder my appreciation once more.\nAs I rush down the stairs, I remind myself that Anderson is also divorced. He\u2019s even got two little girls to take care of. Maybe, this is a shared sympathy?\nHe must know the torture I\u2019ve been enduring since Ryan\u2019s heinous words last night. A divorce is a painful process.\nI believe, however, that my situation is guaranteed worse than anyone will know.\nI manage to catch Mrs. Halloway as she\u2019s putting her papers together to leave. She is kind enough to sit with me for twenty minutes after five as we sign papers, and I\u2019m given the keys to a new apartment to live in.\nI call Annie and Lily in hopes the two women can help me move out tonight. The sooner I\u2019m out of this place, the better.\nAs we\u2019re putting my things into boxes as quickly as possible, the girls prod me with a bunch of questions.\nClearly, everything is moving quickly to them.\n\u201cYou said this is company-provided housing?\u201d Annie asks, incredulous.\n\nChapter 5\nI smile, pushing some curly blonde hair behind my ear and out of my eyes. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d\n\u201cHow much is your rent going to cost?\u201d Lily jumps in.\nI think for a second, putting books into another box. \u201cUh, about two thousand.\u201d\nLily throws a pillow at me, pursing her red lips in my direction as she waves her arms around in the air. \u201cI\u2019m going to murder you!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I laugh, unsure what she\u2019s talking about.\n\u201cI never envied your promotion; everyone knows how hard you work. If I worked late like you, my face would collapse!\u201d\nAnnie says, \u201cBut this, I cannot forgive you for!\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I question, hands on my waist.\nThe two girls look at one another before returning their gazes to me.\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Annie replies, rolling her eyes.\n\u201cCity center,\u201d Lily ticks on her finger.\n\u201cOne thousand square meters,\u201d Annie says next.\n\u201cFully furnished apartment.\u201d\n\u201cSwimming pool, security, a gym downstairs.\u201d\n\u201cOnly 100 meters from the closest shopping center!\u201d\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to kick you out after you\u2019ve signed the contract.\u201d Lily crosses her arms with a satisfying smirk on her face.\nI roll my eyes and sigh but understand they\u2019re having fun at my expense. \u201cGirls, this is the employee care system, okay? I\u2019m getting a divorce.\u201d\nI point at Lily. \u201cAnd you? With one handsome boyfriend after another.\u201d Then, I point at the tall blonde. \u201cAnd you, with a husband that absolutely adores you! Life is fair for the two of you, and there\u2019s no need to be jealous of my pathetic life.\u201d\nI let myself fall to the ground with my legs crossed, exhausted.\nAnnie approaches me, her hand on my shoulder. \u201cWe know, hon,\u201d she reassures me.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re sorry you\u2019re going through all of this right now,\u201d Lily adds, joining us on the floor.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to keep you as happy as we can,\u201d the first woman insists. \u201cYou\u2019re our best friend, Esme, and we just want you to smile.\u201d\nI take both girls around the shoulders and hold them close, so thankful to have the two greatest friends on the planet.\n\u201cWhat the heck would I do without you two?\u201d\nLily shrugs against my embrace. \u201cYou\u2019d probably be packing this place by yourself?\u201d\nAnnie nods matter-of-factly. \u201cAlso, no one would be here to taunt you.\u201d\n\u201cOr remind you that Ryan\u2019s a loser, and you\u2019re a thousand times better off without him!\u201d\n\u201cPlus, then you\u2019d have no one to invite to your new, beautiful, stunning apartment!\u201d Annie finishes, clapping her hands together as I let them both go.\n\u201cYou two are absolutely ridiculous!\u201d I roll my eyes.\n\u201cBut you love us!\u201d They sing song together.\nIt takes only a few hours of rushed packing to get out of the house I\u2019ve lived in for the past several years. I look around one more time once the girls have left, saying goodbye to pieces of my home that will no longer be mine.\nThe perfect window perch to look out at the view around me.\nThe spot on the wooded living room floor where I\u2019d spilled just a touch of black nail polish.\nThe perfect shower and bath combo that I used to lie in for hours at a time enjoying the calm.\nThe walk-in closet is mostly barren now.\nThe steps that I\u2019d tripped down the first time I got a promotion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to say goodbye,\u201d I whisper to the house. The creaks and the shadows that I\u2019ve grown so used to will just become a faded memory. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d\nA creak in the ceiling sounds as if the home is replying to my final words.\n\u201cThank you for these past few years,\u201d I finish, standing in the middle of the living room and taking one final deep breath in.\nThen, I take off my wedding ring and place it on the kitchen table next to my house key. This is it. This is the end of my story here.\nI grab my car keys off the counter by the front door, take one more look around, and then I finally make my exit, knowing there\u2019s no chance I\u2019ll ever walk through this door again.\nI\u2019m no longer Esme, Ryan\u2019s wife.\nNow I\u2019m Esme, a strong, independent woman who is relearning the world around her.\n\u201cYou took your sweet time,\u201d Lily taunts as I finally get into my car downstairs.\n\u201cJust needed to say goodbye,\u201d I insist.\n\u201cOnly you would say goodbye to a freaking house,\u201d Annie says, poking my arm from the passenger seat. Her nails are white today, and I swat her hand away.\n\u201cLet\u2019s gooo, come on!\u201d Lily cries, holding out the second word to annoy us. She jumps up and down in the backseat. \u201cOnward to new adventures, Esme!\u201d\nThe drive to the new apartment isn\u2019t too far. It\u2019s about ten minutes away from the house, and surprisingly, it\u2019s pretty close to our favorite dive, Ransom\u2019s Tavern. That\u2019s pretty perfect since it\u2019s the middle point for all three of us.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Annie whispers as she looks out the window on her side of the car. \u201cLook how beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you said the city center, you really meant it,\u201d I reply to the two, leaning forward in my car to see the apartment building as it towers over us.\n\u201cThe name fits well, too,\u201d Lily adds, pointing out the window ahead of us. I follow her gaze as I see the plaque.\n\u201cCenter City Apartments.\u201d\n\u201cThis is nuts,\u201d I say without really thinking about it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling us,\u201d Lily huffs. \u201cHeck, Esme.\u201d\nWe get a parking spot to the elevators closest to where my unit is supposed to be, and the girls and I start planning our attack.\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s get the important stuff into the bedroom first, and then we\u2019ll grab everything else and put it in the living room,\u201d I instruct.\n\u201cGood plan,\u201d Annie nods, pulling her straight, blonde hair into a ponytail.\nWe spend about an hour just bringing things up to the apartment, moving quickly and laughing with one another about how dumb we all look doing this.\n\u201cHire movers next time!\u201d Lily grunts as she drops a box of clothes on the ground. \u201cIf I\u2019d known this was how I was spending tonight, I\u2019d have told you I was busy!\u201d\nAnnie bumps our friend as she walks by with another box of pictures and memorabilia. \u201cAt least if she hired movers, they\u2019d probably be hot!\u201d\nLily gasps. \u201cOh God, yes! They\u2019d probably be all hot and sweaty and look amazing. Instead, I stink, and I\u2019m tired and hungry!\u201d\nI throw the closest object at Lily, which just so happens to be my car keys. \u201cYou love me, and you\u2019d never leave me in the lurch.\u201d\nAnnie and Lily both shrug at the same time, and the three of us head back to the car for the final round of transferring my stuff.\nOnce we\u2019re done, the two girls decide to utilize the fully furnished couches, but I end up kicking them out so they can each go home and spend time with their men.\n\u201cCall us later if you need some talk therapy?\u201d Annie asks.\nI give her a hug. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me, I\u2019ll be sleeping for the next four days,\u201d Lily deadpans, so I shove her playfully before giving her a hug and watching the two head off together.\nI look around the apartment, not sure where to start. Maybe the best step is to be neighborly and go greet the people who live next store.\nI head out of the door and go to put my new key in my side pocket. However, I accidentally drop the metal onto the ground and crouch down to pick it up.\nSuddenly, as I\u2019m picking up the key, a little missile comes barreling toward me, and the blur crashes into my arms before falling to the ground.\nInstincts take over, and I quickly pick up the small child, an adorable little girl with dark hair. Instantly, she begins to cry as I hold her close and stand back up.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay!\u201d I tell her, bouncing her. \u201cDon\u2019t cry!\u201d\nI look around for an adult, but I\u2019m only met with another girl, a few years older than the first, who looks like a carbon copy. However, she is glaring at me.\n\u201cHow dare you make my sister cry!\u201d She shouts out. \u201cI\u2019m telling my dad on you!\u201d\nThen, as the older girl is yelling, a man in a bathrobe comes running out of the apartment next door, calling out his apologies for his daughter scaring me.\nThe first thing I see is a set of perfect abs, and I have a hard time pulling away from the sight. Wow, what a handsome set of abs.\nMy eyes move up from the abs to the eyes of the tall, tanned man. He looks incredibly relaxed and handsome as he stands in front of me, but it takes me about five seconds longer than it should to put it together.\nI can\u2019t help but gulp as I set down the girl in my arms.\nMy boss\u2026he\u2019s my neighbor?!"

                      "text": "Chapter 0001\nIt was ten o'clock in the evening. Sydney Castro sat in front of the dressing table, rubbing essential oils on her body for that glowing skin.\n\nClearly, she was getting ready to please a man.\n\nHer husband, whom she had not seen for two years, was returning to Somerland today. She missed him terribly.\n\nSydney oiled every part of her body until she was soft and smooth. Then she put on a white, furry lingerie set with a cheeky little cat tail on the small of her back.\n\nIn truth, she did not have to go to such trouble in the past. Lorenzo had wished he could stick to her every day, but after that fateful day, everything changed.\n\nShe went from being his closest lover to the woman he hated the most.\n\nLater, their elders arranged for them to get married. However, Lorenzo was so reluctant that he left the country the day after signing their marriage certificate.\n\nNow two years have passed, during which he only contacted her once. It was six months after her mother's death that he sent her a divorce agreement.\n\nSydney did not sign the papers. She still harbored thoughts of rekindling her marriage with Lorenzo.\n\nHowever, it was difficult.\n\nShe was not even aware he was returning tonight. She only found out when she saw Lorenzo\u2019s friends posted about their drinking session on social media.\n\nLater, she called her mother-in-law, who helped her and sent a driver to bring Lorenzo back.\n\nThe driver called. Lorenzo would be home in a few minutes.\n\nShe had to seize this opportunity and try to rekindle their old flame again.\n\nIntentionally dressed up, she knelt on fours by the bed, evenly distributing the rose petals that had been sprinkled on the bed in advance. She was so engrossed that she did not notice a long shadow walking in.\n\nSuddenly, Sydney\u2019s cat tail was yanked hard as a hot-blooded torso pressed on her back. Her heart skipped a beat. She turned back and came face-to-face with a deep yet intense set of piercing eyes.\n\n\"Enzo...\" she began delicately, \"You finally came...\" Back.\n\nThe rest of her sentence was choked back by a kiss reeking of ethanol.\n\nSydney's eyelashes fluttered as her body responded to his. She was not sure whether Lorenzo was drunk or if her outfit tonight was a success. \n\nLorenzo kissed her so passionately that he wanted to suck her lips swollen. He placed his hands over her waist , grabbing them vigorously.\n\nThe man seemed satisfied. While taking a breath, he growled in a whisper. \"good...\"\n\nGrowling in a whisper was considered flirting. That was Lorenzo\u2019s special habit. \n\nRecently, she had been doing yoga. Her figure was way better than two years ago. This was also a surprise for Lorenzo. His words and actions ignited the fire in her heart.\n\nHer plump waist rose and fell violently. Her rapid breath escaped her rosy lips. Her glowy, fair hands explored his waist through his custom silk shirt, caressing his hard and steamy muscles for the first time in a long time. She hurriedly unbuttoned his shirt.\n\nThe smooth material slid down his strong arms. She unbuckled his belt and wrapped her legs around his waist.\n\nEight years of familiarity with each other made them very compatible in bed. No need for any fluff, they went straight into it.\n\nPerhaps it was because they had not seen each other for too long. His desire seemed to be even more intense than hers, just like when he first tasted the forbidden fruit eight years ago. The man was excited and tireless.\n\nThis went on for more than three hours. Finally, he was satisfied.\n\nSydney laid on the man's beautiful sculpted chest and kissed his handsome face obsessively, trying to make up for lost time.\n\nLorenzo kept his eyes closed, allowing her kisses.\n\n \"I'm very pleased with you tonight.\"Lorenzo said\n\nSydney smiled and kissed the corner of his lips again.\n\nLorenzo raised the corners of his lips. He grabbed her waist hard, and turned over to hold her down.\n\nSydney was sure that he was in a good mood now.\n\nShe stretched out her hand to rub his Adam's apple. Right before they did it again, she said bluntly, \"Enzo, four years ago\u2026I swear nothing happened between Oliver and I. My body and soul completely belong to you. You are finally back. Can we please forget what happened that day and move forward together?\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the smile on the man's face froze instantly.\n\nLorenzo raised his hand and grabbed Sydney\u2019s throat. \n\nSydney's heart skipped a beat. She widened her eyes in panic. It was over. She had said the wrong thing.\n\nThis happened twice before. If she mentioned the words \"four years ago\", Lorenzo would immediately become ruthless and sinister.\n\nHer best friend once said that Lorenzo's reaction was akin to PTSD, a post-traumatic stress reaction.\n\nShe had doubts at the time, and it turned out to be the same today, which proved that her best friend was right.\n\nIn a daze, she heard Lorenzo say, \"Move forward with me? You?\n\n\"I touched you tonight because I'm afraid that you,  wouldn\u2019t change your disgusting habit and sleep with my friends again!\"\n\n\"I won't, I didn\u2019t...\" Sydney explained and reached out to touch his hand, attempting to soothe him.\n\nLorenzo's hand tightened, \"Don't touch me!\"\n\nSydney's face was red from Lorenzo\u2019s grip on her throat.\n\nLorenzo took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. \"You'd better sign the divorce agreement as soon as possible. The past love we had will never be rekindled.\"\n\n The words \u2018divorce agreement\u2019 stabbed Sydney\u2019s heart like a sword. She looked up anxiously, and said with difficulty, \"We were so good back then. Are you going to completely deny all that I\u2019ve done for you, just because of that incident?\n\n\"Oliver and I both explained back then that nothing happened to us. We were set up!\"\n\nHowever, the more she explained, the angrier Lorenzo became. His hand went up her neck and grabbed her chin. The force in his grip became stronger and stronger. Sydney could feel that he wanted to crush her chin.\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\nHe ignored her cries of pain.\n\n\"Set up? Lying on the same bed with him might be a set up, but what about the child in your belly?\"\n\n\"Sydney, I wanted so badly for that baby to be mine at that time... But all the hospitals we went to in Quill City showed the same result: You were fifteen days conceived a baby.!\n\n\"I was on a business trip for two months and you were fifteen days conceived a baby. How could you make me believe that nothing happened between you and him?!\"\n\nAfter that, Lorenzo shook her off.\n\nSydney fell on the pillow. She straightened her messy hair, stood up again and explained shakily, \"But the first doctor I consulted was a traditional medicine practitioner. The old doctor said that I was two months conceived a baby. I didn't tell you immediately because I wanted to wait for you to come back to give you a surprise!\n\n\"You\u2019ve met that old doctor too. He showed you the prescription he gave me with the time written on it. Why won't you...\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Lorenzo interrupted her, \"Handwritten time has no credibility, and it's easier to bribe an old traditional medicine practitioner. Stop now and shut up!\"\n\nShe stood in his shoes and could understand the hurt in his heart. However, she still felt heartbroken from how he decisively shunned her.\n\nEspecially their child. The rejection was heartbreakingly painful.\n\nShe knew it was useless to say anything, so she kept quiet and shed tears of frustration.\n\nLorenzo got out of bed and made a phone call.\n\nThe room was quiet. As the call connected, Sydney heard the voice on the other end. She quickly got out of bed.\n\nA woman\u2019s voice. \"Mr. Bailey\u2026\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"Are you still here?\"\n\nWoman, \"Yes, do you want to come over?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lorenzo said and hung up the phone. \n\nSydney held him back. Her eyes widened with tears and her voice trembled. \"Are you seeing someone else?\"\n\nChapter 0002\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\nSydney\u2019s world collapsed as she burst into tears. \"When did it happen?! Who is she?!\"\n\nShe looked utterly miserable now. Lorenzo had no mercy, he might have even felt a little pleasure seeing her in pain.\n\n\"Can\u2019t stand seeing me with someone else?\"\n\nYes, she could not stand it.\n\nLoving a person would inherently make one possessive. Lorenzo meant so much to her that she could not accept losing him.\n\nAt this moment, the way she was just speechlessly hyperventilating due to the blow was more pathetic than crying. It felt like she was falling to pieces.\n\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He got dressed and left the bedroom.\n\nSydney refused to give up and chased after him. \"Why won\u2019t you believe that I was set up?\"\n\nLorenzo stopped and turned around. \"Then tell me, who set you up?\"\n\nThe corridor of the mansion was wide and long. Sydney was speechless as she looked at the lanky man in white shirt and trousers.    \n\nFour years ago, they talked about this many times. Each time they got stuck here.\n\nExactly.\n\nShe still did not find out who did it.\n\nThe setup was extremely vicious.\n\nLorenzo and Sydney\u2019s relationship turned from true love to pure hatred. They were so miserable for each other that it broke apart Lorenzo and Oliver\u2019s friendship. It also caused Sydney to become mentally ill, miscarrying from extreme heartache...\n\nHowever, she still could not identify the mastermind behind this! Four years ago, Sydney and Oliver searched for a long time but to no avail.\n\nLorenzo left.\n\nSydney stood in the corridor for a long time. She clutched her chest and raced towards the room at the corner of the corridor, calling out with each step, \"Mrs. Harper...\"\n\nHer breath became shorter each time.\n\nWhen she reached the door, she reached out and knocked, then her vision went dark as she fell to the ground unconscious.\n\nThe door opened shortly. The nanny had the shock of her life and quickly picked Sydney up in panic. \"Madam!\"\n\nThe sound of a car driving away was heard downstairs.\n\nSydney regained consciousness after Mrs. Harper gave her first aid.\n\nMrs. Harper had a glass of water and a handful of white pills in her hand. She said, \"Madam, why don't you tell your husband about your condition? If he sympathizes with you because of this, you might...\"\n\nSydney shook her head stubbornly, \"He and I are together because we love each other. I don't want to be pitied.\"\n\nShe took the pills and swallowed them. She closed her eyes and kept silent for a long time, then she said to Mrs. Harper, \"He\u2019s seeing someone else. I want to know who she is. Tell me, is it okay for me to ask his friends?\"\n\n\u2026\n\nMelon, the largest nightclub in Quill City.\n\nMusic was blaring in a VIP room. Lorenzo kicked the door open and went in. The men who were dancing intimately with the women almost soiled their pants.\n\nHowever, no one dared to be angry.\n\nLorenzo was a peculiar legend in Quill City. In his youth, he was an uncivilized and rebellious devil. Despite being a member of the Bailey Group, the wealthiest corporation in Quill City, he was cast out as the black sheep of the family and was dead broke.\n\nLater, his parents could not stand it anymore and made a plan for him to study abroad. He refused without hesitation. Instead, he relied on the prize money he got from a gaming tournament and simply enrolled himself in a vocational school.\n\nSuch a self-destructive person suddenly changed at the age of twenty.\n\nLorenzo became extremely hard-working. He diligently went to class and hung out in the library. He would also dress up and leave the dormitory at around six o'clock every morning. He rode the bicycle for an hour to Quill City Fine Arts Academy for lectures.\n\nSome people claimed that he had fallen in love with a student from Quill City Fine Arts Academy.\n\nNot long after, he wanted to start a company. His family was not supportive, of course. So, he put a knife to Grandpa Bailey\u2019s throat and grabbed 300 million to open a jewelry company, registered as Cherr.y.\n\nAt that time, the Baileys thought that the 300 million was burned for good. However, Cherr.y turned out to be unexpectedly successful. It made ten times the profit in its second year. In the fourth year, it was listed in Newford.\n\nToday, the \u2018Black Sheep\u2019 was a self-made man and had become the heir to the Bailey Group. Cherr.y had become a world-renowned jewelry brand.\n\nAs soon as Lorenzo sat down on the sofa, a group of beauties quickly came over and said, \"Mr. Bailey!\"\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nThe women trembled in fright and scurried away. Two more men sat down and said, \"Lorenzo, what pissed you off at home?\"\n\nLorenzo kept quiet. He picked up a glass and started chugging.\n\nThe others did not say anything anymore. They picked up their glass to drink with him.\n\nNot a moment later, someone's cell phone rang on the table.\n\n\"Xavier, your phone!\"\n\nA handsome man with platinum blond hair sat up on the sofa in a dark hidden corner.\n\nXavier woke up from his nap and scratched his tattooed neck. He took a look at his cell phone and his eyes widened.\n\n\"Lorenzo,\" he looked at Lorenzo, \"Why is Sydney calling me?\"\n\nLorenzo paused mid-drink and looked at Xavier. \"Who?\"\n\nXavier walked up to him with his cell phone, \"Your wife!\"\n\nLorenzo's expression turned sinister. \"When did you get her number?\"\n\nXavier said casually, \"On the day you both got married, I gave her my number when we sang together in the karaoke bar.\"\n\nHearing that, Lorenzo stood up abruptly and grabbed Xavier's collar, \"Who asked you to give your number?\"\n\nXavier frowned, puzzled at his friend\u2019s sudden rage. He pushed Lorenzo's hand away, \"We were all having fun, what\u2019s the big deal in exchanging contact information?\"\n\nLorenzo got angry. \"WHY\"\n\nWith that, he punched the undefended Xavier.\n\nXavier was caught off guard and slammed onto the marble table. The wine and glasses on the table clattered onto the floor.\n\nThe atmosphere froze. Lorenzo's eyes turned red like a furious beast. He growled, \"Delete her number!\"\n\nXavier was no sitting duck either. He was the second generation of the Altmans, an old money family in Quill City.  He was the prodigal son of the Altmans, a notorious troublemaker. He could hang out frequently with Lorenzo because they were similar.\n\nXavier wiped the bleeding corner of his lips and punched Lorenzo in return. \"What's going on, Popeye? Use your words, not your fists!\"\n\nLorenzo was hit on the head. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then he grabbed Xavier, pressed him on the sofa and beat him in a frenzy. \"How many times have you contacted Sydney in the past two years?!!\"\n\nXavier dodged Lorenzo's heavy punches and said, \"Why would I contact your wife like I have nothing else to do?! Have you gone mad? I'll admit you to the mental hospital!\"\n\nThese words seemed to hit a nerve. Lorenzo paused. \n\nHe was stunned for a few seconds. Then, he sat down on the side and then closed his eyes to quell the anger in his heart.\n\nXavier sat up, frowned and rubbed his shoulders. Vulgarities spewed.\n\nLorenzo ignored Xavier. After a while, he calmed down. He opened his eagle eyes and scanned the other men in the room, \"Who else saved her number?\"\n\nImmediately, several men lowered their heads to look for their phones.\n\nLorenzo was startled.\n\nImmediately, terrifying sounds of broken bottles filled the space, as well as Lorenzo's angry swear words, and screams of women as they dodge shards of glass.\n\nLorenzo seemed to have lost his mind and started attacking all his friends.\n\nXavier stepped outside with his cell phone and returned Sydney\u2019s call.\n\nWhen Sydney picked up, Xavier humbly said, \"Hi, Sydney. What's the matter?\"\n\nSydney's voice was gentle and polite. \"Xavier, I'm sorry to bother you. Lorenzo got a little upset with me tonight. He blocked me and I can't contact him. I wanted to ask if you know where he is.\"\n\nChapter 0003\n\"He was drinking with me, and now he's drunk and acting crazy. I'll send him back to you later. Don\u2019t worry.\"\n\nSydney paused for a moment then said, \"Can you give me the address? I want to check on him myself.\"\n\nXavier took a deep breath, opened the door and saw the chaos inside. He said, \"Melon, A.\"\n\nAbout ten minutes later, apart from Lorenzo and Xavier, everyone else left.\n\nLorenzo sat on the sofa. He stared at the chandelier on the ceiling, lost in thoughts.\n\nXavier sat next to him, \"We are not a part of your drama with Sydney. If anything, go home and solve it with her. Don't go crazy here.\"\n\nLorenzo closed his eyes. \"I\u2019m not going home.\"\n\n\"You must,\" \"Then tell me what happened between you two, I\u2019ll find a way for you.\"\n\nLorenzo, \"You can't.\"\n\n\u201cFine,\" Xavier said, \"If you won't go home, where will you go later?\"\n\n\"Chelsea will pick me up.\"\n\nXavier was stunned for a moment. \"Are you okay? You got so anxious when your wife called me. And now you\u2019re going to see another woman?\n\n\"I met you late. I don't know what happened between you and Sydney. You left her alone for two years, acting like you really don't care. However, we are not allowed to keep her contact information. What on earth are you thinking?\"\n\nLorenzo became impatient again. \"Boy, don\u2019t meddle with adult matters.\"\n\nWhen Xavier started to curse, a creaking sound came from the door. The two of them looked towards the door.\n\n\u201cEnzo,\u201d A sweet voice came.\n\nThe woman had the body of a devil and the face of an angel as she slithered in. She was the \u2018Nation\u2019s Goddess\u2019 and top tier actress, Chelsea Dune.\n \nLorenzo's expression finally softened a little when she appeared. \"Here she comes.\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows subtly.\n\nChelsea elegantly sat next to Lorenzo while avoiding the mess on the ground. She saw the cut at the corner of his eye.\n\nThe woman frowned. \"Why are you hurt?\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"It's nothing. I just drank too much.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt?\" As she spoke, Chelsea reached out and took Lorenzo's arm.\n\nXavier said with a smile, \"Hey Superstar, do you know he is married?\"\n\nChelsea paused and retracted her hand in embarrassment. \"Enzo and I are just friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, cool.\"\n\nLorenzo seemed displeased with Xavier's sarcasm towards Chelsea. He retorted, \"What are you trying to say?\"\n\nXavier stuck his tongue in his cheek and stood up with a grin. \"Nothing. Things among you guys are too complicated for my little brain. I\u2019m gonna go home to bed.\"\n\nAs soon as Xavier reached the door, the door was opened from the outside.\n\nXavier paused.\n\nSydney stood timidly at the door.\n\nShe was timid but she was objectively eye-catching.\n\nHer long, dark and wavy hair draped casually down her back. She had light makeup on her delicate and pretty face. Her lips were as bright as cherry, with a hint of sparkle.\n\nThe velvet, burgundy strappy dress contrasted with her flawless, snow-white skin. She was like a blooming red rose in the dark night.\n\nXavier gulped. He forgot how to speak at that moment.\n\nLorenzo's voice was suddenly heard. \"Who\u2019s there?\"\n\nXavier was stunned,and stepped aside to make way for Sydney. After Sydney entered the room, he exhaled and came back to his senses.\n\nAs soon as Sydney reached the door, she froze.\n\nEveryone had left. The private room had the brightest lights turned on. Right in the middle, Lorenzo and Chelsea were sitting together with their arms touching each other. To Sydney, that scene hurt her eyes more than the light.\n\nHer breath was stuck in her throat. Her lips quivered, but she could not say a word.\n\nLorenzo had an affair with Chelsea, her college bully!\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Lorenzo frowned, \"Go back!\"\n\nSydney shuddered then finally took a step. She quickened her pace.\n\nShe went up to the two of them. While everyone was caught off guard, she slapped Chelsea across the face and grabbed her hair. \"It's you!\"\n\nChelsea screamed, \"Ah! Enzo, help me!\"\n\n\u201cSydney!\u201d\n\nWhen Lorenzo spoke, Sydney let go of Chelsea. She raised her hand towards Lorenzo, but did not strike him.\n\nHer hands trembled. She broke down and shouted, \"You clearly know what she did to me back then! Of all the people, why her?!\"\n\nSuddenly.\n\nSlap!\n\nChelsea took advantage when Sydney was unguarded and slapped her back. That slap was even harder than Sydney\u2019s.\n\nSydney felt ringing in her ears, and then blood dripped from the corners of her lips.\n\nChelsea snarled, \"Why blame others if you can't keep your man?!\"\n\nSydney held her face. Her eyes turned red at Chelsea\u2019s smug expression. She shouted, \"I'm taking your life. \n\nShe tried to attack Chelsea again, but Lorenzo stopped her. He grabbed the back of her head and threw her to the other side of the sofa.\n\n\"I told you to go back, are you deaf?\"\n\nSydney felt as if she had gone deaf. The ringing in her ears was so severe that she couldn't hear what Lorenzo said. Half of her head was throbbing.\n\nAt this moment, Chelsea suddenly covered her ears and wailed, \"Enzo, I can't hear!\"\n\nLorenzo was shocked, \"You can\u2019t hear?\"\n\nChelsea's eyes widened in pity, and her cries became louder. \"I can't hear what you said...\"\n\nLorenzo looked back and glared at Sydney fiercely. He stood up, arms over Chelsea and walked out, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier, saw Lorenzo escorting a tearful Chelsea out of the room. He knew something was amiss and quickly entered the room.\n\nSydney closed her eyes and clasped her head with her hands. She fell sideways on the sofa. Her shoulders shook.\n\nAt the moment, half of that bright and charming face was as pale as paper, and the other half was marked with an angry palm print. The blood on the corners of her lips stood out even more.\n\nXavier's eyes widened and he rushed over. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney did not respond.\n\nXavier nudged her gently. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney then opened her eyes, her voice fading away, \"My, my ears hurt...\"\n\nWith the slap mark and her ear hurting, Xavier immediately understood what had happened. He helped Sydney up and said, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\nSydney only managed to take two steps before her legs gave way. She was about to crash.\n\nPeople lose strength when they cannot bear the pain. Sydney would rather die than have Lorenzo cheated on her with Chelsea.\n\nXavier felt a pang of distress. He carried Sydney in his arms and hurried out.\n\n\u2026\n\nLorenzo and Chelsea stopped outside the main entrance of Melon. He said, \"Wait for me here, I'll get the car.\"\n\nChelsea held him and said, \"Enzo, I'm better now. I don\u2019t think I need to go to the hospital. Come with me and stay with me, okay?\"\n\nLorenzo frowned, and just as he was about to agree, something behind Chelsea attracted his attention.\n\nXavier carried Sydney and walked quickly towards the parking lot.\n\nLorenzo frowned, \"Since you don't need to go to the hospital, you should go back to the hotel first.\"\n\nWith that, he turned to chase after Xavier, but Chelsea pulled him back. \"Are you going to look for Sydney? How could she treat you like that but you still can't let her go?\"\n\nChapter 0004\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He did not answer and strode after Xavier.\n\nChelsea exhaled forcefully. Her shoulders trembled. She looked at Sydney and Xavier with clear hatred and jealousy.\n\nHowever, Lorenzo did not manage to intercept Xavier. When he passed by, Xavier's car drifted gorgeously before merging onto the main freeway.\n\n\u2026\n\nInside the car.\n\nSydney crumpled into a ball and leaned against the car window. Xavier fastened the seat belt for her.\n\nTears streamed down her face the whole time, but she was expressionless, like a soulless sculpture.\n\nThe pain in her ear strained the nerves across her head, and pulled out many memories that she did not want to recall.\n\nA group of heavily made-up girls surrounded her. The proudest one leading the pack, was Chelsea, the one with the harmless face.\n\nHer smile was pure evil. She pulled Sydney\u2019s hair, and let her companions take turns to slap her. Chelsea dripped melted white ice cream on Sydney\u2019s face and chest.\n\nSydney dared not resist because her grandmother, Mary Collins, was in the hands of Christopher, Chelsea's father.\n\nThe Dunes were quite wealthy. Christopher owned a ceramics company, and Mary used to work as a cleaner in Christopher\u2019s office building.\n\nMary had always done a good job, but that day Chelsea insisted that Mary accidentally destroyed her father's documents. Even a fool knew that it was all a farce.\n\nSydney was a freshman that year and Chelsea was a sophomore.\n\nAt the Quill City Fine Arts Academy, Chelsea had always been the most sought-after goddess by many in the school. After Sydney entered the school, she stole Chelsea\u2019s glory.\n\nJealousy was written all over Chelsea's innocent face.\n\nChelsea took those humiliating photos and made Sydney look cheap. Soon, other people's harsh words tormented her as well.\n\nSydney, you are so pretty. If You planned turns a resentful woman,would your grandma still need to be a cleaner in her old age to support the family?\n\n\"Sydney! Hey, Sydney!\"\n\nXavier's words pulled her back from her thoughts.\n\nShe turned her head blankly to be met with a pair of gentle, concerned eyes.\n\nXavier saw her motionless and thought she had died with her eyes wide open.\n\nThe speed of the car was fast, and the pressure on her back felt comfortable. Sydney took the pills earlier and felt better because her discomfort was suppressed. Her ears still hurt but she could hear clearly.\n\n\"Xavier, thank you.\"\n\nXavier breathed out, \"As long as you're fine.\"\n\nSydney continued to be silent.\n\nIt was already four o'clock in the middle of the night. There were very few cars on the road.\n\nAfter Xavier turned a corner, he looked back at her.\n\nHis Adam's apple rolled quietly once more.\n\nSydney looked bright and charming from the front, but she looked even more striking with her smooth facial outline and high nose from the side. Her thick eyelashes were naturally curled; It felt like she was God\u2019s favorite.\n\nSydney stood out even among beauties and was considered stunning. She was spotted by a talent scout when she hit puberty in her first year of high school.\n\nHowever, her mother refused to allow her to enter the entertainment industry, so she had been keeping her head down at school. Initially, her mother had strict requirements. Sydney was not allowed to have long hair or wear nice clothes.\n\nThroughout high school, she had ugly short hair and wore puffy, outdated and tacky clothes. She was bullied when she started dressing up in college. It was not until she fell in love with that Black Sheep Enzo that she began to step out of her shell because she had someone to protect her.\n\nXavier broke the silence in the car again. \"You knew that all the boys have only known Lorenzo in the past three or four years. Am I right to say that you and Lorenzo have known each other for a long time?\"\n\nWith that, Sydney said, \"Yeah, he was my first love. I dated him when I was a freshman. He stayed with me throughout my college days for four years. We broke up when I graduated...\"\n\n\"After two years of separation, the elders in our respective families crossed paths by accident, and they arranged for us to get married for some reason. I was willing to get married, but he was not.\"\n\nXavier frowned. \"Do you...love him very much?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Sydney\u2019s voice trembled again, \"He used to be... very good to me. Extremely good.\"\n\nShe was deeply caught up by their love, whereby a simple sentence could dig up those heavy and profound memories.\n\n\"I don't have a father. Lorenzo not only gave me the sense of security that a boyfriend should, but he was protective like a father.\n\n\"For every holiday, others are picked up by their parents, but Lorenzo picked me up. At every start of the school season, parents would send their kids to class, but Lorenzo would send me. The day before school started, he would help me check my luggage. He would make sure I had everything I needed. He would also secretly put money into the pockets of my clothes.\u201d\n\nSydney's tears rolled down her cheeks again as she recalled those memories.\n\nXavier tightened his grip on the steering wheel. His expression became heavy. He did not expect Lorenzo to have such a tender and considerate side.\n\nHowever, tenderness and consideration were the most fearful things in a relationship because trying to move on after a breakup was tantamount to chipping away at the bones.\n\nAfter a moment, Xavier spoke, \"You are now... relying on his past kindness to you to support your marriage.\"\n\nThis sentence summed up her lonely married life for the past two years. Sydney lifted her hand and wiped her eyes, \"I am not willing to lose him. We were so good together; I really can't accept the current situation...\"\n   \n\nXavier said, \"But Sydney, have you ever thought about it? Many couples who have been estranged were once deeply in love in the past. You\u2019ve been tormenting yourself by living in the past. You will definitely meet a man who treats you better in the future.\"\n\nSydney sobbed, \"I tried moving on, but I still can't get over...\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows and changed his approach. \"Chelsea hit you, but he took Chelsea away without concern for you. Can you bear it?\"\n\nSydney was stunned for a moment. The hidden deep affection in her eyes was immediately replaced by hatred as her emotions flared up.\n\n\"No, I told Lorenzo from the start that anyone who is friends with Chelsea is my enemy. Did Lorenzo really have feelings for Chelsea, or did he do it deliberately to spite me...\n\n\"No, I can't think like that either,\" she began to mumble through her chaotic thoughts, \"No matter what his purpose is, if he really slept with Chelsea...\"\n\nShe did not continue, but closed her eyes and began to take deep breaths.\n\nSome scenes were just fantasies, but enough to suffocate her.\n\nXavier's heart ached a little when he saw Sydney in pain. At the same time, he was also curious about what happened between Sydney and Chelsea.\n\nJust as he was about to ask, his cell phone, which he had thrown inside the armrest storage, rang.\n\nHe looked down. It was a call from Lorenzo.\n\nXavier frowned, turned over his phone and clicked to hang up. He glanced in the rearview mirror again.\n\nBehind him was a flashy, black and red car, the world\u2019s rarest supercar. A toy owned by the richest man in Quill City.\n\nXavier looked at Sydney again. Her sobs could really melt a man's heart. He secretly gripped the steering wheel.\n\nIt was not Sydney who gave him her number first. The men, including him, noticed Lorenzo's indifference towards her, but were too captivated by her beauty, so they asked for it behind Lorenzo's back.\n\nOf course, they all found a perfect reason. They asked Sydney to leave her number, so they could contact her for business purposes.\n\nAt that time, no one dared to have filthy intentions. She was Lorenzo's legal wife, and Lorenzo was one of the most outstanding people among his friends.\n\nAside from the fact that Sydney was married, she was indeed a rare beauty. Everyone thought it was harmless to keep a beautiful woman\u2019s phone number.\n\nHowever, things were different now.\n\nHe swerved the steering wheel abruptly and turned around in the opposite direction. He accelerated to 200 miles an hour, and threw Lorenzo off his trail.\n\nChapter 0005\nXavier was driving dangerously fast, but his expression was exceptionally calm.\n\nIn addition to running several companies, he was also a part-time F2 racing driver.\n\nFor Lorenzo, the supercar was just a means of transportation, but in Xavier's hands, it was a toy. He was sure that Lorenzo would not be able to catch up.\n\nLorenzo watched Xavier's car zoom by his car like a ghost. He was stunned for a moment and quickly turned around. Two minutes later, he lost them.\n\nHe continued to call Xavier while flooring the accelerator, but still no one answered.\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier knew that he had other intentions when he ditched Lorenzo, but he dared not show it in front of Sydney right away.\n\nAfter all, she was still Lorenzo's wife. Xavier was one year younger than Lorenzo whom he regarded as his blood brother, so she was his sister-in-law, in a sense.\n\nHe took her to the hospital as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter the medical check-up to make sure there were no major problems, Xavier took Sydney back to Celestial Park after applying ice patches to her face.\n\nCelestial Park was a famous luxury residential area in Quill City. Sydney and Lorenzo bought their marital home here.\n\nAs soon as Sydney got to the bedroom, she saw Lorenzo sitting on the sofa at the end of the bed. There was a bottle of white wine on the round table next to him.\n\nSydney's eyes flashed. Without saying a word, she went to bed, lay down, and closed her eyes.\n\nA few seconds later, the man's footsteps were heard.\n\nSydney shivered. Her eyelashes became wet again.\n\nLorenzo suddenly got on the bed and pressed on her. She opened her eyes and started to push him away. \"Don't touch me...\"\n\nLorenzo paused, grabbed her collar with both hands, and tore her skirt apart.\n\nSydney's eyes widened with shock. Her screams echoed through the bedroom. \"Don't touch me with the hand you used to touch Chelsea Dune!\"\n\nLorenzo froze.\n\nSydney looked at him as tears poured down her face. \"I can have no dignity in front of you because we were dependent on each other for those four years. You provided a great deal for me, and you are also the closest person to me besides my mother and grandmother. My heart breaks for you because you were hurt by what happened back then. I can\u2019t bear to see you in deep pain every day because of me so I allow you to vent your grievances by hurting me!\n\n\u201cBut I can't share the same man with Chelsea, and I can't have the hand that touched her, touch me!!\n\n\u201cShe is the last straw of my dignity, Lorenzo!\"\n\nHowever, these words did not move Lorenzo to show any guilt.\n\nInstead, he became angrier. \"What about my last straw?\"\n\n\"I was disgusted by you too after Oliver touched you. What you do that night when we got registered?\"\n  \nSydney trembled. She choked.\n\nThat night.\n  \nHer mother and mother-in-law both wanted to seize the opportunity so that she and Lorenzo could have a child as soon as possible, so they tampered with their tea.\n\nLorenzo thought it was Sydney who Framed him.\n\n\"Why aren't you talking?\" Lorenzo's eyes were red as he stared into hers, \"Where did Xavier take you? He deliberately didn't answer my call. What did you do?\"\n\n\"Can you stop being suspicious of everyone and anyone? He took me to the hospital!\"\n\n\"Hospital?\" Lorenzo sneered, and he tightened his grip on her clothes, this time tearing her skirt all the way, \"Sydney, lift your legs for me!\"\n\nSydney panicked. \"What are you going to do?!\"\n\n\"Let's see if you betrayed me again!\"\n\nSydney immediately closed her knees together, \"I didn't!\"\n\nLorenzo pressed harder and his voice became more forceful, \"I don't believe a word you said!\"\n\nSuch stubborn words made Sydney lose the will to refute him.\n\nShe looked at Lorenzo\u2019s frightening and gloomy face and felt disgusted with him for the first time.\n\nShe reached out and pinched the back of his hand. \"Let me go, I'm tired, I want to sleep!\"\n\n\"I don't want to sleep, why should you sleep!\" Lorenzo was still furious. He did not seem to feel any pain in the back of his hand. The grip in his hand became stronger and stronger.\n\nHe pulled apart Sydney's knees quickly. He spread her legs apart so hard that even her behinds hurt.\n\nHe was worried that she would resist, so he pressed his knee on her belly and untied his belt.\n\nSydney's tears rolled to the side of her temples and wet the pillow. Still, she said nothing. Since pinching the back of his hand did not work, she pinched his neck hard.\n\nLorenzo winced in pain, but still did not let her go.\n\nIt felt as if he would not give up if he did not test her.\n\nLorenzo's neck,and even his arms and abdominal muscles were left bruised from Sydney's pinching while she gradually lost hope.\n\nShe wilted like dry roses, losing all trace of vitality.\n\nLorenzo endured the pain and tried to control her, but failed.\n\nSydney's tearful eyes trembled. Her hand squeezing his chest loosened, and she finally spoke again, \"Is that enough?\"\n\n\"Enough?\" Unexpectedly, Lorenzo felt even more enraged. He reached out and yanked open the drawer on the bedside table, took out the bottle of essential oil she bought, and then slammed the drawer shut!\n\nSydney seized this opportunity and tried to escape, but he grabbed her ankle in time. \"Be good!\"\n\nSydney stopped resisting. She knew she would not be able to escape tonight.\n\nShe was in tears, but she laughed. \"Lorenzo, I really didn't expect that one day I would be disgusted with you. Go ahead, disgust me more. So I can hate you enough, and give you what you want...\"\n\nShe thought, \u2018Lorenzo should know what I was referring to.\u2019\n\nIn the split second, her refusal to sign the divorce agreement suddenly wavered.\n\nDuring the time between being taken away by Xavier and being sent back home, she had been recalling the past.\n\nWhen she recalled the past with Chelsea, she did not want to lose her self-esteem. However, when she recalled every moment with Lorenzo, she did not want to regret losing the man she loved most.\n\nShe was deeply confused by these opposing feelings.\n\nHowever, right now, she actually felt disgusted with the man she loved most.\n\nShe was glad.\n\nDisgusted by him meant that she could finally let him go one day. \n\nLorenzo's face darkened at Sydney\u2019s words. He could not tell whether he was angry or something else.\n\nShe wanted to say more, but Lorenzo's lips suddenly covered hers.\n\nAt the same time, his fingertips of both hands trailed up along her waistline.\n\nThe faint smell of tobacco mixed with the fragrance and wine was an alluring masculine aroma. In the past, she could never resist his kisses.\n\nLorenzo was even wilder in the past than he is now. He was like a lion in the savanna. The passion and impulse he made her feel was strong and without restraint.\n\nApart from the four years they were separated, they had slept together for four years until now. He understood every part of her body, her preferred tension and pressure.\n\nSoon, her body reacted uncontrollably."

                      "text": "Chapter 1    \nI had thought it would be the most romantic day ever. There were two pieces of good news to celebrate today: my 3rd wedding anniversary and the fact that I'd just gotten a promotion.\nI walk eagerly to the man I love, stretching onto my toes to kiss Ryan. But he ducks, pushing something into my arms.\nWhen I unwrapped it, my whole body froze.\nA divorce document.\n\u201cThat's what I want. \u201c Ryan said coldly. His arms crossed over his chest.\u201d Honestly, I'm sick and tired of this. You're not taking care of our home. \u201d\nIt took me a minute to comprehend the current situation.\u201d It wasn't April Fool's Day. \u201d\nExasperated, Ryan rolls his angry eyes at me and gestures to the room around us. \u201c Do you know what it\u2019s like to walk into a room with cat hair everywhere and a carpet that hasn\u2019t been cleaned in months? \u201d\nMy eyes widen, my head pulling back to look at my husband. \u201cLet me remind you that I make twice as much as you do and that I am the one who pays for the cleaners. Yet, I distinctly remember conversing with you a long time ago where we agreed to take turns dividing our workload!\u201d\nThe counter-argument makes Ryan grunt, throwing his head back as he stares at the ceiling. \u201cI earn money too, Esme!\u201d He snaps at me.\n\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem here?\u201d\n\u201cThe problem? Why don\u2019t I have a housewife? You can\u2019t even be bothered to bring me a child to raise!\u201d\n\u201cMe? You do realize I want to have this baby, too, right? You\u2019re the one who refuses to go with me to the hospital! Maybe if you were a bit more active\u2014\u201d\nRyan interrupts me with a laugh that silences me.\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d He spits, seemingly implying that I\u2019m a liar. \u201cYou\u2019re having an affair with your boss; don\u2019t deny it!\u201d\nMr. Anderson? Derek Anderson? The confusion seems to proliferate, and the facial expressions that take over my face feel like a dream.\nThe only thing that is true about my boss is that he\u2019s a dashing divorced man. I\u2019m dazed at the idea my husband accuses me of sneaking behind his back.\n\u201cI can absolutely assure you, Ryan, that there never has and never will be anything regarding my boss! I am his subordinate, and there\u2019s nothing left to discuss about Mr. Anderson!\u201d\nHis arms cross over his chest again, huffing. \u201cYou\u2019re so delusional that your work has given you everything you desire when, in fact, it is your boss.\u201d\n\u201cFine. You want this divorce and to live in your fantasy world where I\u2019m the villain? I\u2019ll sign your freaking divorce papers, but not right now. For now, I\u2019m going to find a competent lawyer to help me properly divide my property from you.\u201d\nI start rushing toward the front door, needing to escape this house, this man, this absurdity.\nBut I hear Ryan chasing me down the hall. \u201cEsme! Quit stalling for more time or to conjure up new lies. If you have a clean conscience, then you should sign the papers today.\u201d\nHe grabs my arm and whirls me around, and for the first time since I met Ryan, I don\u2019t recognize the man. His eyes are dark, his skin ice cold as his fingers wrap around my upper arm, and his voice full of disgust.\nI shake my head, ripping my arm from his grasp, slap my husband in the face, and I leave the house with papers in hand and my heart bleeding on the floor in front of the man.\nHappy anniversary to me.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to murder the scum!\u201d\nMy best friends, Annie and Lily, sit at the bar on either side of me. Ransom\u2019s Tavern is our favorite place to drown our sorrows, and Lily is basically ready to go all Jeffery Dahmer on Ryan.\n\u201cAnd on your anniversary of all days! Who asks for a divorce on the day two people get married? He better be ready for me because I\u2019m going to end his entire life with one freaking punch to the face!\u201d\nI can\u2019t help but laugh at Lily as she puts up her fists like she\u2019s preparing for battle. Her nose scrunches up, and her eyebrows hide behind her brown bangs.\n\u201cCalm yourself,\u201d Annie instructs our friend.\n\u201cCalm? How can you be calm? He\u2019s just told our best friend that she\u2019s only where she is in her career because she\u2019s been sleeping with her boss! Do you know how incredibly misogynistic and disgusting that is?\u201d\n\u201cTalk louder; I don\u2019t think the entire block heard you,\u201d I reply as I take a drink. This is the last thing I need. I rub my left temple, my curly blonde hair quickly becoming tangled in my fingers.\n\u201cMoving on!\u201d Annie instructs, waving her perfectly manicured hand at Lily. Then, touching my hand on the sticky bar, Annie states seriously, \u201cEsme, if I were you, I\u2019d go to your boss\u2019 house and sleep with him. Now.\u201d\nI roll my eyes as I give the two women a sad smile. \u201cCome on, my boss isn\u2019t like you, guys. He\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s got a lot of responsibilities on his plate.\u201d\n\u201cUh, isn\u2019t your boss single now?\u201d Lily questions.\nI shrug, taking another sip of my watery beer. \u201cHe\u2019s got two daughters, and from what I\u2019ve heard, he takes care of them independently.\u201d\n\u201cAka, he\u2019s single and maybe ready to mingle?\u201d Annie teases, biting her bottom lip at her joke.\nI nudge my shoulder against hers, unable to keep a laugh from rising out of me. \u201cStop it!\u201d\nI wouldn\u2019t be shocked if Anderson is single, especially since he never works overtime. He always leaves as soon as the clock strikes five like Cinderella leaving the ball at midnight.\nBut as I sit here, I start to wonder if the booze has already saturated my mind. Because suddenly, Anderson is all I\u2019m able to think about.\nWho would it hurt if I were to maybe\u2026text him? Ryan would be furious, absolutely floored at my gall. But my anger, my desire to hurt the man who I\u2019d married three years ago, fuels my rage.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to text him,\u201d I tell the girls, pulling out my phone. I\u2019m going to tell him exactly where I am right now and use this to relieve some of the anger.\nGetting back at Ryan for his selfish and pathetic behavior? Better than giving him a swift kick in his special little place.\n\u201cNo way. Prove it!\u201d Annie smirks, looking down at my phone lying on the bar.\nI pick up the phone, typing in Anderson\u2019s name in my messages. I\u2019ll send him my address as if supposedly informing a friend of my whereabouts. Then, after about a minute, I\u2019ll just tell him I\u2019d sent the message to the wrong person.\nNo harm, no foul.\nBesides, it\u2019s already 8:45. It must be parenting time for Anderson.\nI type in the address to Ransom\u2019s Tavern and hit send. I put down the phone, my friends laughing and shoving me with disbelief.\nTo my surprise, my phone buzzes back immediately with a reply.\n\u201cFive minutes.\u201d\n\nChapter 2\n\u201cNo way, no way!\u201d Annie squeals as she grabs my phone from my hands. Her pale blue eyes sparkle with mischief. \u201cLily, he\u2019s coming!\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Lily shouts, reaching across me to take my phone next, pushing a piece of her short brown hair away from her face.\n\u201cThis is absolutely crazy. I can\u2019t even believe it! Five minutes? That\u2019s so fast!\u201d Annie cries, her arm catapulting back for the phone.\n\u201cOh my God, I\u2019m so excited, I can\u2019t wait to see what he looks like!\u201d Lily adds, jumping in her bar seat with excitement.\nThe two of them are growing louder by the second, and now I\u2019m starting to get a headache and regret my message.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you just point out that he\u2019s got two daughters? It\u2019s a school night. He\u2019s probably spending time with the kids,\u201d Lily points out as Annie re-reads the texts for the tenth time.\n\u201cWhat do you think this means?\u201d Annie asks, still staring at my phone.\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll bring them along,\u201d Lily gushes.\nI\u2019m too stunned to say anything. Did I really do this to myself? I can\u2019t even believe it!\nAs if a magic wand is waved over my head, I feel the drunkenness clears up instantly, and now I\u2019m sweating from every possible place I can think of.\n\u201cHe\u2026he must have thought I was contacting him for a work-related matter,\u201d I find myself stammering to the girls. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly dedicated.\u201d\nAnnie shakes her head. \u201cExcept this is outside of work hours, honey. Besides, he knows this is a pub, yet here he is, rushing over like your knight in shining armor!\u201d\nShe and Lily scream again, their bodies jumping up and down in the bar seats as they shake their arms in the air.\nWell, if the drunkenness has left, then bring on the hangover because I am far too sober for this.\nI\u2019m honestly speechless now. My friends must be overthinking things, surely. I mean, Anderson is just so professional in the office. He cares for his subordinates, and I know that.\nBesides, I\u2019ve never messaged him outside of the working hours in the past, so that must have made him inclined to believe it must be something serious.\nEven if that\u2019s not the case, I can\u2019t help but continue panicking in my head over the fact Anderson will be here soon.\nAs the end of the five minutes approaches, Lily and Annie decide to step aside to let me handle this situation on my own. They sit at a table in the back of the bar, watching me like I\u2019m their newest form of entertainment.\nI better come up with a perfect lie. I\u2019m starting to sweat and growing more nervous by the second for Anderson to show up. Maybe something about how work has been a struggle, or I\u2019ve had a few difficult clients?\nAs the thoughts run through my head, they\u2019re quickly sent away when Anderson walks into the bar in an elegant, perfectly tailored suit. His eyes search for me before landing on the bar, and he smiles gently.\nStanding at what I can imagine to be over six feet tall, Derek Anderson is a white yet tanned man in his late thirties with dark brown hair on his head. He has his usual dark smudges under his eyes, which match his exhaustion. He\u2019s also just about one of the most good-looking men I\u2019ve ever seen.\nI quickly scramble to my feet once he enters, realizing I have absolutely no idea what I must look like. A wreck, probably, considering I just got dumped by my own husband. Is my hair okay? What about my makeup?\nOh man, what about my breath?\nAnderson approaches, keeping his smile spread out on his face. I take a deep breath, and tell myself to calm down.\n\u201cCongratulations on your promotion, Esme,\u201d Anderson says once he\u2019s closed the distance. He looks really good tonight.\n\u201cT-Thank you,\u201d I stutter out, trying to keep my composure. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to taking on the new responsibilities.\u201d\nWe both sit at the bar together, still keeping one another in our line of sight.\nI do put a lot of time into my job, and it is genuinely rewarding and fulfilling. I mean, the years I\u2019ve put into it have given me such a rush of pride. But thinking of Ryan\u2019s complaints scratches at the surface of my skin.\n\u201cI brought you a gift to celebrate,\u201d Anderson states, holding out a small bag for me to take from him.\nSurprised, I reached out for the bag. What could he have possibly grabbed for me in the five minutes it took for him to arrive?\n\u201cThank you, Mr. Anderson, that\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d\nHe gestures to the bag. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you open it?\u201d\nI look down at the bag, feeling awkward about opening his gift right here, but do as he asks.\nI can\u2019t contain my absolute shock when I pull the gift out of the bag. A jewelry box?\nI slowly open the box, seeing a beautiful necklace inside. My jaw drops.\n\u201cW-w-what? How did you\u2014?\u201d\nAnderson gives me a sheepish smile, nodding at the box. \u201cI happened to notice your phone\u2019s wallpaper recently, and\u2026\u201d He rubs the back of his neck. \u201cI hope that it wasn\u2019t too personal.\u201d\nI can\u2019t hide my stunned expression. This is so thoughtful of Anderson, and I raise my eyes to his. How do I even thank him for this?\nThe necklace, a beautiful silver chain with a dark blue heart wrapped around it, was supposed to be a gift hint for Ryan to find. I picked it out because I knew how perfect it would match my own dark blue eyes.\nI\u2019ve been eyeing this for weeks and was so, so hopeful he would figure out my desire to own it.\nI\u2019m so confused because this is like my dream wedding anniversary! Though, in reality, it\u2019s all a mess\u2014yet here I stand with my own boss, my eyes wide and mouth agape as I hold onto the beautiful jewelry.\nThis is Anderson handing over this gift, though. Not my own husband.\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting a divorce!\u201d I blurt out without a thought.\nMy boss\u2019s expression morphs, and he gives off a strange expression. \u201cSorry?\u201d He questions.\nAt this very moment, I notice something pink on the corner of Anderson\u2019s suit. Is that\u2026Peppa Pig? A sticker?\nGod, what the heck am I doing? This is my boss! He\u2019s a mature man with children and professional conduct. A full-fledged, single father with no need for some random employee to take up his incredibly important time.\nI take one deep breath, then another. Calm down a second. This day has been such a whirlwind that I must have gotten swept up in the kind gesture from Anderson.\nMy nerves are growing, and I feel inexplicably and desperately wanting to escape this incredibly awkward situation. My personal life doesn\u2019t need to be brought up in front of Anderson, so what am I doing talking to him like we\u2019re old friends catching up?\nOut of professionalism, it\u2019s imperative that my personal matters are handled privately and have nothing to do with him. What am I even doing calling him to the bar and divulging that I\u2019m leaving Ryan behind?\nAbruptly, I make my voice sound natural, though it doesn\u2019t feel as such. \u201cWhat I meant to say was,\u201d I start, another breath to calm myself. \u201cI\u2019d like to request time off.\u201d\nAnderson raises his left eyebrow.\nI nearly cough. \u201cI need to handle the\u2026related paperwork, if that\u2019s okay, sir?\u201d\nIt feels like a bowling ball has landed on my chest as I watch his expression go unchanging. God, of all the times, to sound like a complete bumbling mess, it has to be in front of my boss.\n\nChapter 3\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d Anderson asks after the silence becomes too stuffy. He\u2019s frowning slightly, and I notice his posture slightly worsen.\nIn my head, I\u2019m thinking, What else? After all, when he arrived, he had no clue about my fight with Ryan. Does he even know today was our anniversary?\nFor some reason, as I continue to stare at the man, I feel a sense of something. Is it\u2026disappointment? Why?\nInstead of probing him with more questions, I nod my head up at the tall man. His eyes, dark and honestly somewhat mysterious, crash against my skin like a hot laser burning into me.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all, yes,\u201d I finally reply.\nI look at Anderson, and then my eyes drift over to Annie and Lily in the corner of the bar. They\u2019re watching so intensely you\u2019d think they've never seen two people interact before. I feel severe discomfort with their daggers.\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Anderson says, straightening his suit jacket. \u201cYour time off is approved. If there is anything else I can do for you, please let me know.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I say to him, wanting to give a smile but struggling to let myself give one away. He\u2019s a kind man, and I appreciate his understanding.\n\u201cOf course. Though, I have one more question, Esme.\u201d\nI turn my head to the side at the statement.\n\u201cAre you here alone tonight?\u201d Anderson\u2019s voice seems to warble a bit, and it throws me off for a moment. Did it matter if I\u2019m here by myself or not?\nNot wanting to lie but still feeling a bit nervous, I nod my head again. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d\nAnderson stands back up to depart, wiping something off of his jacket. As he does this, a waiter comes up to me and deposits a drink in front of me.\n\u201cOh, no, I didn\u2019t order\u2014\u201d I start to say, unsure where this mystery drink came from.\n\u201cCharge it double and put it on my tab,\u201d Anderson deadpans, handing over his card to the waiter, who quickly swipes it through and gives it back.\n\u201cSir, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d\nBefore I can speak, Anderson returns the card to his pocket. \u201cGoodnight, Esme. I hope your paperwork is sorted out shortly.\u201d\n\u201cBut sir, you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d I\u2019m sputtering, but he holds up his hand to stop my sentence again.\n\u201cEnjoy your night.\u201d\nAnderson then walks out of the bar alone, and I can\u2019t help but stare in disbelief at the man as he disappears behind the walls. What the heck just happened?\nThat was all so weird, and I\u2019m struggling to find any words to say now that I\u2019ve been left alone at the bar.\nIt takes another few seconds, but Annie and Lily come rushing over with bright eyes. I can tell the two are ready to start interrogating me for what happened between us, but in truth, I don\u2019t have any words for them.\nInstead, all I can do is gesture with my hands at what is before me. The necklace, the drink, and my confusion are all present.\nI want to tell them I don\u2019t know what happened, but I think my face is saying that enough. Because I don\u2019t know anything. This was all just\u2026random?\nLily, snickering to herself, mimics Anderson under her breath with her large smile. \u201cI\u2019ll pay double.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d Annie pushes, and I just shrug.\n\u201cOh, come on! He walks in here and hands you some fancy jewelry and then hands over his card without even knowing what you\u2019re drinking. That was him clearly flirting!\u201d Lily says dreamily.\n\u201cHardly,\u201d my voice croaks.\n\u201cHow many men would come into this bar and do the exact same thing, though, Esme?\u201d Annie insists. \u201cThat man just swept you off your feet!\u201d\nI look at the door where Anderson exited, wanting to ask him what is going through his head. But that\u2019s the issue. Now he\u2019s left again, and I\u2019m left wondering what this day has turned into.\nA freaking fiasco, for sure.\nLater, after finally getting Lily and Annie to let me leave the bar and return home, I climb into my empty bed.\nAlone for the first time in years, I feel helpless over my foreseeable future. It\u2019s hard to judge whether things will be good or not with Ryan already pushing and shoving his way out the door.\nWhat am I supposed to do about all of this? Today should have been perfect. Ryan could have swept me off my feet, and we could have had a romantic dinner together, shared gifts and kisses and laughter, and enjoyed ourselves. Instead, here I am, holding back tears against my pillow.\nI got a promotion, and on my wedding anniversary at the age of 30, I\u2019m about to lose my marriage. What\u2019s worse is I\u2019m still childless, which causes my heart to strain. I don\u2019t want that label. I don\u2019t want that nightmare.\nNow, I\u2019m going to be the divorced single woman everywhere I try to go.\nOr, maybe, a single, divorced career woman.\nThough, that seems to be even more stressful than the divorced woman label.\nI shake my head out on the pillow, throwing my face into the sheet. This is all happening so bloody fast that I\u2019m unsure what else to do.\nAnd on top of everything bad that\u2019s happened today, I can\u2019t stop replaying Anderson\u2019s facial expressions and kindness toward me. He\u2019s a genuinely kind individual, so having him attempt to comfort me was sympathetic.\nI can\u2019t imagine Ryan doing the same for me, even if we are still married. His compassionate side has never been his strong suit.\nThen again, maybe I\u2019ve just been wearing rose-tinted glasses the whole time, and he was never a good husband to begin with. I guess it\u2019s possible to be lost in a world of love.\nGrunting and rolling over to get out of bed, I realize that sleep shall continue to evade unless I do something about it.\nGrabbing my wallet and a light jacket to cover my pajamas, I finally exit my place, trudging downstairs and out into the world to fix this incredibly horrid headache and insomnia.\nAround the corner from my place is a 24-hour convenience store. Maybe the clinic will have the meds I\u2019m looking for. Regardless, I\u2019m so over this day, and I just want to sleep and have it be tomorrow.\nThe best way forward is through, after all.\nI shuffle into the clinic, making my way to the medication section. I tend to pick up whatever the strongest medications happen to be on the shelf.\nAt this rate, they\u2019re going to need to make a simple medication to calm my anxiety, too.\nMaybe I should go back to the doctor. My insomnia hasn\u2019t really corrupted my sleep and made me this tired in years. But clearly, I\u2019ll be struggling for the foreseeable future.\nI shuffle into the next aisle to grab a large bottle of water to take with my meds. As I get to the front of the store to pay for my supplies, I hear a voice I recognize.\n\u201cIs this the right one, you think?\u201d He asks another person nearby.\nI stretch my neck, seeing the one person I\u2019m desperately trying not to think about.\nI see the short haired blonde first, and I\u2019m surprised to see Ryan standing in the aisle just to the left of me. Then, I hear a second voice.\n\u201cMaybe we get this one,\u201d she replies.\nI narrow my eyes, and as I thank the man at the counter, I walk over to the two people.\nIt\u2019s Ryan alright, but the person he\u2019s with?\nMy cousin, Melinda. With her picture-perfect beauty and her short black hair pulled into a pathetic excuse for a ponytail, I look at the two of them down the aisle.\nAnd the object they\u2019re talking about is a freaking test stick?\n\nChapter 4\n\u201cYou really had to do this to me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Melinda complains as they pick up another stick to examine. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have used protection before you got the divorce?\u201d\n\u201cBabe, it\u2019s going to be fine because we\u2019re going to be divorced soon! Esme\u2014that freaking foolish woman\u2014she\u2019s got no idea about us! Besides, she\u2019s got significantly more savings than I do, and soon, we\u2019re going to inherit a fortune!\u201d\n\u201cYou better hope so, dummy,\u201d Melinda grunts as she turns the pink box over in her hands. \u201cThis is stressing me out.\u201d\n\u201cLook, we\u2019ll inherit the money, we\u2019ll be rich, and you and I will be together. You should get knocked up immediately, unlike Esme. She can\u2019t even have kids!\u201d\nI feel my heart turn cold, my skin burns, and my anger blinds me. This cheater! This whole time, I thought our main issue was over not having children!\nMy fingers strain around the bottles I hold, and a million different things cross my mind to screech at these two people; people I trusted!\nThis entire marriage has never hindered kids; it\u2019s only ever been for Ryan to divorce me and take my money! That spineless, pathetic scum.\n\u201cMelinda! What the heck?\u201d I screech at the two, giving away my position. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you got into bed with him!\u201d\nThe two of them turn to look at me, eyebrows raised, and, at least in my cousin\u2019s face, a slight hint of fear.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Ryan demands.\n\u201cHearing you plan your new life.\u201d I glower at my soon-to-be ex-husband. \u201cYou really think I\u2019m this foolish?\u201d\n\u201cOh no, I don\u2019t think it, I know it!\u201d Ryan retorts back.\nI look straight at my cousin, my eyes falling into slits as I speak the truth. \u201cI don\u2019t have children. No. But maybe that\u2019s because this man\u2019s got useless seeds.\u201d\nI jab a finger in Ryan\u2019s direction. \u201cI won\u2019t let you parasites take a single penny from me! This is freaking war.\u201d\nI stomp out of the pharmacy with a new purpose and officially wide awake. I\u2019m not letting this ship go down. Just the opposite: I\u2019m going to ruin their lives.\nI\u2019m getting a lawyer, gathering all the evidence, and I\u2019m taking them down every peg possible.\nBut first, I need to move out of this place. The thought of Ryan and Melinda doing it in my bed makes me want to vomit.\nI spend the night putting together what I can find, refusing to let sleep take me away from my work.\nOnce the sun comes up, I start chugging coffee, heading into the office to ask if any of my colleagues know anything about nearby rental options.\nI let myself get lost in my job and rental searches, frantic as I let the day whiz by me. It\u2019s not until I stop for a moment in the daze of anger and work that I realize two things:\nThe first one is that I told Anderson I needed time off, and I still came into the office today.\nThe second one is that it\u2019s almost five, and I have two messages from my boss asking me to come to his office when I have a moment.\n\u201cHeck!\u201d I whisper. I stand up abruptly, grab my phone, and throw it into my pocket, rushing down the hall to Anderson\u2019s office. God, this is going to look really weird, isn\u2019t it?\nI knock on the door and straighten myself out, but in my head, I know I\u2019m going to look like a mess.\n\u201cCome in,\u201d I hear Anderson call, and I slowly open the door.\n\u201cHi,\u201d I say shyly, moving forward into the room.\n\u201cAh, Esme,\u201d he smiles. He gestures at me. \u201cCome in, close the door behind you.\u201d\nOh God, am I being fired?\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, I didn\u2019t see your messages until just now. I was busy with my work.\u201d\nHe nods but tells me to sit down. \u201cNo problem, I just wanted to discuss something with you.\u201d\nThe moment my body touches the soft cushion of the chair, I\u2019m quick to explain. \u201cI completely forgot that I\u2019d asked for time off, and then I didn\u2019t even remember until I read your messages! I\u2019m so sorry for\u2014\u201d\nHe holds up a hand to stop me, and I listen, confused. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I called you in here.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d I say, shrinking into the chair. If I could just disappear into thin air right now, that\u2019d be wonderful.\n\u201cI did, however, want to ask you if you\u2019re alright. You do seem a bit\u2026tense.\u201d\nI need the power of invisibility right about now.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I lie.\n\u201cAnd the conversations around the office about you looking for rental options?\u201d\nHeck, I\u2019ve been caught.\n\u201cAre you looking for a place, Esme?\u201d He asks again.\nHe must have listened in on one of those conversations because I only spoke to a few people, and they were relatively short ones.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, really, I hope you can understand that this has been a difficult time for me. I\u2019m sorry for discussing personal matters during work hours.\u201d\nHe raises his hands to me to calm me.\n\u201cEsme, take a breath. It\u2019s fine; we have a comprehensive employee care system.\u201d Anderson gives me a deep look, seemingly looking for something. \u201cConsidering your\u2026special situation, the company has some housing allowances for employees.\u201d\nI sit up straighter. \u201cReally?\u201d\nThe man nods. \u201cYes.\u201d\nI let a long sigh out. \u201cOh, wow, okay, thank you, sir. And thank you for not telling anyone about the divorce. I haven\u2019t told anyone, and I\u2019m not exactly ready for the entire thing to go public.\u201d\nHe nods again. \u201cThat\u2019s tough, and I understand.\u201d\nI feel compelled to apologize again; this information on the housing is incredibly helpful, and I\u2019m so sleep-deprived that it actually seems like a good idea to shake his hand and give him a hug.\nGet your things together, Esme.\nHis small smile and that nod, however, make me feel a special spark ripple through me. Finally, someone understands and has given me the best encouragement I\u2019ve received yet.\nI\u2019m so grateful for his kindness, but a few tears prickle the corners of my eyes. Something about his stature and genuine concern for my well-being and home life makes me feel closer to Anderson than to my own friends.\n\u201cI appreciate the information and for everything you\u2019ve done for me, sir.\u201d\n\u201cMy best employee deserves to know that she is a valuable member to the team. If you\u2019re not in top fighting shape, then we all lose, correct?\u201d\nI nod vigorously. \u201cOf course, yes.\u201d\n\u201cVery well. Go speak to Mrs. Halloway on the third floor about your housing request, and she should be able to get everything sorted out for you today. Hurry, though, she\u2019ll be leaving any minute.\u201d\nI jump up, and without really thinking, I get moving, calling over my shoulder my appreciation once more.\nAs I rush down the stairs, I remind myself that Anderson is also divorced. He\u2019s even got two little girls to take care of. Maybe, this is a shared sympathy?\nHe must know the torture I\u2019ve been enduring since Ryan\u2019s heinous words last night. A divorce is a painful process.\nI believe, however, that my situation is guaranteed worse than anyone will know.\nI manage to catch Mrs. Halloway as she\u2019s putting her papers together to leave. She is kind enough to sit with me for twenty minutes after five as we sign papers, and I\u2019m given the keys to a new apartment to live in.\nI call Annie and Lily in hopes the two women can help me move out tonight. The sooner I\u2019m out of this place, the better.\nAs we\u2019re putting my things into boxes as quickly as possible, the girls prod me with a bunch of questions.\nClearly, everything is moving quickly to them.\n\u201cYou said this is company-provided housing?\u201d Annie asks, incredulous.\n\nChapter 5\nI smile, pushing some curly blonde hair behind my ear and out of my eyes. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d\n\u201cHow much is your rent going to cost?\u201d Lily jumps in.\nI think for a second, putting books into another box. \u201cUh, about two thousand.\u201d\nLily throws a pillow at me, pursing her red lips in my direction as she waves her arms around in the air. \u201cI\u2019m going to murder you!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I laugh, unsure what she\u2019s talking about.\n\u201cI never envied your promotion; everyone knows how hard you work. If I worked late like you, my face would collapse!\u201d\nAnnie says, \u201cBut this, I cannot forgive you for!\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I question, hands on my waist.\nThe two girls look at one another before returning their gazes to me.\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Annie replies, rolling her eyes.\n\u201cCity center,\u201d Lily ticks on her finger.\n\u201cOne thousand square meters,\u201d Annie says next.\n\u201cFully furnished apartment.\u201d\n\u201cSwimming pool, security, a gym downstairs.\u201d\n\u201cOnly 100 meters from the closest shopping center!\u201d\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to kick you out after you\u2019ve signed the contract.\u201d Lily crosses her arms with a satisfying smirk on her face.\nI roll my eyes and sigh but understand they\u2019re having fun at my expense. \u201cGirls, this is the employee care system, okay? I\u2019m getting a divorce.\u201d\nI point at Lily. \u201cAnd you? With one handsome boyfriend after another.\u201d Then, I point at the tall blonde. \u201cAnd you, with a husband that absolutely adores you! Life is fair for the two of you, and there\u2019s no need to be jealous of my pathetic life.\u201d\nI let myself fall to the ground with my legs crossed, exhausted.\nAnnie approaches me, her hand on my shoulder. \u201cWe know, hon,\u201d she reassures me.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re sorry you\u2019re going through all of this right now,\u201d Lily adds, joining us on the floor.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to keep you as happy as we can,\u201d the first woman insists. \u201cYou\u2019re our best friend, Esme, and we just want you to smile.\u201d\nI take both girls around the shoulders and hold them close, so thankful to have the two greatest friends on the planet.\n\u201cWhat the heck would I do without you two?\u201d\nLily shrugs against my embrace. \u201cYou\u2019d probably be packing this place by yourself?\u201d\nAnnie nods matter-of-factly. \u201cAlso, no one would be here to taunt you.\u201d\n\u201cOr remind you that Ryan\u2019s a loser, and you\u2019re a thousand times better off without him!\u201d\n\u201cPlus, then you\u2019d have no one to invite to your new, beautiful, stunning apartment!\u201d Annie finishes, clapping her hands together as I let them both go.\n\u201cYou two are absolutely ridiculous!\u201d I roll my eyes.\n\u201cBut you love us!\u201d They sing song together.\nIt takes only a few hours of rushed packing to get out of the house I\u2019ve lived in for the past several years. I look around one more time once the girls have left, saying goodbye to pieces of my home that will no longer be mine.\nThe perfect window perch to look out at the view around me.\nThe spot on the wooded living room floor where I\u2019d spilled just a touch of black nail polish.\nThe perfect shower and bath combo that I used to lie in for hours at a time enjoying the calm.\nThe walk-in closet is mostly barren now.\nThe steps that I\u2019d tripped down the first time I got a promotion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to say goodbye,\u201d I whisper to the house. The creaks and the shadows that I\u2019ve grown so used to will just become a faded memory. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d\nA creak in the ceiling sounds as if the home is replying to my final words.\n\u201cThank you for these past few years,\u201d I finish, standing in the middle of the living room and taking one final deep breath in.\nThen, I take off my wedding ring and place it on the kitchen table next to my house key. This is it. This is the end of my story here.\nI grab my car keys off the counter by the front door, take one more look around, and then I finally make my exit, knowing there\u2019s no chance I\u2019ll ever walk through this door again.\nI\u2019m no longer Esme, Ryan\u2019s wife.\nNow I\u2019m Esme, a strong, independent woman who is relearning the world around her.\n\u201cYou took your sweet time,\u201d Lily taunts as I finally get into my car downstairs.\n\u201cJust needed to say goodbye,\u201d I insist.\n\u201cOnly you would say goodbye to a freaking house,\u201d Annie says, poking my arm from the passenger seat. Her nails are white today, and I swat her hand away.\n\u201cLet\u2019s gooo, come on!\u201d Lily cries, holding out the second word to annoy us. She jumps up and down in the backseat. \u201cOnward to new adventures, Esme!\u201d\nThe drive to the new apartment isn\u2019t too far. It\u2019s about ten minutes away from the house, and surprisingly, it\u2019s pretty close to our favorite dive, Ransom\u2019s Tavern. That\u2019s pretty perfect since it\u2019s the middle point for all three of us.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Annie whispers as she looks out the window on her side of the car. \u201cLook how beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you said the city center, you really meant it,\u201d I reply to the two, leaning forward in my car to see the apartment building as it towers over us.\n\u201cThe name fits well, too,\u201d Lily adds, pointing out the window ahead of us. I follow her gaze as I see the plaque.\n\u201cCenter City Apartments.\u201d\n\u201cThis is nuts,\u201d I say without really thinking about it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling us,\u201d Lily huffs. \u201cHeck, Esme.\u201d\nWe get a parking spot to the elevators closest to where my unit is supposed to be, and the girls and I start planning our attack.\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s get the important stuff into the bedroom first, and then we\u2019ll grab everything else and put it in the living room,\u201d I instruct.\n\u201cGood plan,\u201d Annie nods, pulling her straight, blonde hair into a ponytail.\nWe spend about an hour just bringing things up to the apartment, moving quickly and laughing with one another about how dumb we all look doing this.\n\u201cHire movers next time!\u201d Lily grunts as she drops a box of clothes on the ground. \u201cIf I\u2019d known this was how I was spending tonight, I\u2019d have told you I was busy!\u201d\nAnnie bumps our friend as she walks by with another box of pictures and memorabilia. \u201cAt least if she hired movers, they\u2019d probably be hot!\u201d\nLily gasps. \u201cOh God, yes! They\u2019d probably be all hot and sweaty and look amazing. Instead, I stink, and I\u2019m tired and hungry!\u201d\nI throw the closest object at Lily, which just so happens to be my car keys. \u201cYou love me, and you\u2019d never leave me in the lurch.\u201d\nAnnie and Lily both shrug at the same time, and the three of us head back to the car for the final round of transferring my stuff.\nOnce we\u2019re done, the two girls decide to utilize the fully furnished couches, but I end up kicking them out so they can each go home and spend time with their men.\n\u201cCall us later if you need some talk therapy?\u201d Annie asks.\nI give her a hug. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me, I\u2019ll be sleeping for the next four days,\u201d Lily deadpans, so I shove her playfully before giving her a hug and watching the two head off together.\nI look around the apartment, not sure where to start. Maybe the best step is to be neighborly and go greet the people who live next store.\nI head out of the door and go to put my new key in my side pocket. However, I accidentally drop the metal onto the ground and crouch down to pick it up.\nSuddenly, as I\u2019m picking up the key, a little missile comes barreling toward me, and the blur crashes into my arms before falling to the ground.\nInstincts take over, and I quickly pick up the small child, an adorable little girl with dark hair. Instantly, she begins to cry as I hold her close and stand back up.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay!\u201d I tell her, bouncing her. \u201cDon\u2019t cry!\u201d\nI look around for an adult, but I\u2019m only met with another girl, a few years older than the first, who looks like a carbon copy. However, she is glaring at me.\n\u201cHow dare you make my sister cry!\u201d She shouts out. \u201cI\u2019m telling my dad on you!\u201d\nThen, as the older girl is yelling, a man in a bathrobe comes running out of the apartment next door, calling out his apologies for his daughter scaring me.\nThe first thing I see is a set of perfect abs, and I have a hard time pulling away from the sight. Wow, what a handsome set of abs.\nMy eyes move up from the abs to the eyes of the tall, tanned man. He looks incredibly relaxed and handsome as he stands in front of me, but it takes me about five seconds longer than it should to put it together.\nI can\u2019t help but gulp as I set down the girl in my arms.\nMy boss\u2026he\u2019s my neighbor?!"

                      "text": "Chapter 0001\nIt was ten o'clock in the evening. Sydney Castro sat in front of the dressing table, rubbing essential oils on her body for that glowing skin.\n\nClearly, she was getting ready to please a man.\n\nHer husband, whom she had not seen for two years, was returning to Somerland today. She missed him terribly.\n\nSydney oiled every part of her body until she was soft and smooth. Then she put on a white, furry lingerie set with a cheeky little cat tail on the small of her back.\n\nIn truth, she did not have to go to such trouble in the past. Lorenzo had wished he could stick to her every day, but after that fateful day, everything changed.\n\nShe went from being his closest lover to the woman he hated the most.\n\nLater, their elders arranged for them to get married. However, Lorenzo was so reluctant that he left the country the day after signing their marriage certificate.\n\nNow two years have passed, during which he only contacted her once. It was six months after her mother's death that he sent her a divorce agreement.\n\nSydney did not sign the papers. She still harbored thoughts of rekindling her marriage with Lorenzo.\n\nHowever, it was difficult.\n\nShe was not even aware he was returning tonight. She only found out when she saw Lorenzo\u2019s friends posted about their drinking session on social media.\n\nLater, she called her mother-in-law, who helped her and sent a driver to bring Lorenzo back.\n\nThe driver called. Lorenzo would be home in a few minutes.\n\nShe had to seize this opportunity and try to rekindle their old flame again.\n\nIntentionally dressed up, she knelt on fours by the bed, evenly distributing the rose petals that had been sprinkled on the bed in advance. She was so engrossed that she did not notice a long shadow walking in.\n\nSuddenly, Sydney\u2019s cat tail was yanked hard as a hot-blooded torso pressed on her back. Her heart skipped a beat. She turned back and came face-to-face with a deep yet intense set of piercing eyes.\n\n\"Enzo...\" she began delicately, \"You finally came...\" Back.\n\nThe rest of her sentence was choked back by a kiss reeking of ethanol.\n\nSydney's eyelashes fluttered as her body responded to his. She was not sure whether Lorenzo was drunk or if her outfit tonight was a success. \n\nLorenzo kissed her so passionately that he wanted to suck her lips swollen. He placed his hands over her waist , grabbing them vigorously.\n\nThe man seemed satisfied. While taking a breath, he growled in a whisper. \"good...\"\n\nGrowling in a whisper was considered flirting. That was Lorenzo\u2019s special habit. \n\nRecently, she had been doing yoga. Her figure was way better than two years ago. This was also a surprise for Lorenzo. His words and actions ignited the fire in her heart.\n\nHer plump waist rose and fell violently. Her rapid breath escaped her rosy lips. Her glowy, fair hands explored his waist through his custom silk shirt, caressing his hard and steamy muscles for the first time in a long time. She hurriedly unbuttoned his shirt.\n\nThe smooth material slid down his strong arms. She unbuckled his belt and wrapped her legs around his waist.\n\nEight years of familiarity with each other made them very compatible in bed. No need for any fluff, they went straight into it.\n\nPerhaps it was because they had not seen each other for too long. His desire seemed to be even more intense than hers, just like when he first tasted the forbidden fruit eight years ago. The man was excited and tireless.\n\nThis went on for more than three hours. Finally, he was satisfied.\n\nSydney laid on the man's beautiful sculpted chest and kissed his handsome face obsessively, trying to make up for lost time.\n\nLorenzo kept his eyes closed, allowing her kisses.\n\n \"I'm very pleased with you tonight.\"Lorenzo said\n\nSydney smiled and kissed the corner of his lips again.\n\nLorenzo raised the corners of his lips. He grabbed her waist hard, and turned over to hold her down.\n\nSydney was sure that he was in a good mood now.\n\nShe stretched out her hand to rub his Adam's apple. Right before they did it again, she said bluntly, \"Enzo, four years ago\u2026I swear nothing happened between Oliver and I. My body and soul completely belong to you. You are finally back. Can we please forget what happened that day and move forward together?\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the smile on the man's face froze instantly.\n\nLorenzo raised his hand and grabbed Sydney\u2019s throat. \n\nSydney's heart skipped a beat. She widened her eyes in panic. It was over. She had said the wrong thing.\n\nThis happened twice before. If she mentioned the words \"four years ago\", Lorenzo would immediately become ruthless and sinister.\n\nHer best friend once said that Lorenzo's reaction was akin to PTSD, a post-traumatic stress reaction.\n\nShe had doubts at the time, and it turned out to be the same today, which proved that her best friend was right.\n\nIn a daze, she heard Lorenzo say, \"Move forward with me? You?\n\n\"I touched you tonight because I'm afraid that you,  wouldn\u2019t change your disgusting habit and sleep with my friends again!\"\n\n\"I won't, I didn\u2019t...\" Sydney explained and reached out to touch his hand, attempting to soothe him.\n\nLorenzo's hand tightened, \"Don't touch me!\"\n\nSydney's face was red from Lorenzo\u2019s grip on her throat.\n\nLorenzo took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. \"You'd better sign the divorce agreement as soon as possible. The past love we had will never be rekindled.\"\n\n The words \u2018divorce agreement\u2019 stabbed Sydney\u2019s heart like a sword. She looked up anxiously, and said with difficulty, \"We were so good back then. Are you going to completely deny all that I\u2019ve done for you, just because of that incident?\n\n\"Oliver and I both explained back then that nothing happened to us. We were set up!\"\n\nHowever, the more she explained, the angrier Lorenzo became. His hand went up her neck and grabbed her chin. The force in his grip became stronger and stronger. Sydney could feel that he wanted to crush her chin.\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\nHe ignored her cries of pain.\n\n\"Set up? Lying on the same bed with him might be a set up, but what about the child in your belly?\"\n\n\"Sydney, I wanted so badly for that baby to be mine at that time... But all the hospitals we went to in Quill City showed the same result: You were fifteen days conceived a baby.!\n\n\"I was on a business trip for two months and you were fifteen days conceived a baby. How could you make me believe that nothing happened between you and him?!\"\n\nAfter that, Lorenzo shook her off.\n\nSydney fell on the pillow. She straightened her messy hair, stood up again and explained shakily, \"But the first doctor I consulted was a traditional medicine practitioner. The old doctor said that I was two months conceived a baby. I didn't tell you immediately because I wanted to wait for you to come back to give you a surprise!\n\n\"You\u2019ve met that old doctor too. He showed you the prescription he gave me with the time written on it. Why won't you...\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Lorenzo interrupted her, \"Handwritten time has no credibility, and it's easier to bribe an old traditional medicine practitioner. Stop now and shut up!\"\n\nShe stood in his shoes and could understand the hurt in his heart. However, she still felt heartbroken from how he decisively shunned her.\n\nEspecially their child. The rejection was heartbreakingly painful.\n\nShe knew it was useless to say anything, so she kept quiet and shed tears of frustration.\n\nLorenzo got out of bed and made a phone call.\n\nThe room was quiet. As the call connected, Sydney heard the voice on the other end. She quickly got out of bed.\n\nA woman\u2019s voice. \"Mr. Bailey\u2026\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"Are you still here?\"\n\nWoman, \"Yes, do you want to come over?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lorenzo said and hung up the phone. \n\nSydney held him back. Her eyes widened with tears and her voice trembled. \"Are you seeing someone else?\"\n\nChapter 0002\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\nSydney\u2019s world collapsed as she burst into tears. \"When did it happen?! Who is she?!\"\n\nShe looked utterly miserable now. Lorenzo had no mercy, he might have even felt a little pleasure seeing her in pain.\n\n\"Can\u2019t stand seeing me with someone else?\"\n\nYes, she could not stand it.\n\nLoving a person would inherently make one possessive. Lorenzo meant so much to her that she could not accept losing him.\n\nAt this moment, the way she was just speechlessly hyperventilating due to the blow was more pathetic than crying. It felt like she was falling to pieces.\n\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He got dressed and left the bedroom.\n\nSydney refused to give up and chased after him. \"Why won\u2019t you believe that I was set up?\"\n\nLorenzo stopped and turned around. \"Then tell me, who set you up?\"\n\nThe corridor of the mansion was wide and long. Sydney was speechless as she looked at the lanky man in white shirt and trousers.    \n\nFour years ago, they talked about this many times. Each time they got stuck here.\n\nExactly.\n\nShe still did not find out who did it.\n\nThe setup was extremely vicious.\n\nLorenzo and Sydney\u2019s relationship turned from true love to pure hatred. They were so miserable for each other that it broke apart Lorenzo and Oliver\u2019s friendship. It also caused Sydney to become mentally ill, miscarrying from extreme heartache...\n\nHowever, she still could not identify the mastermind behind this! Four years ago, Sydney and Oliver searched for a long time but to no avail.\n\nLorenzo left.\n\nSydney stood in the corridor for a long time. She clutched her chest and raced towards the room at the corner of the corridor, calling out with each step, \"Mrs. Harper...\"\n\nHer breath became shorter each time.\n\nWhen she reached the door, she reached out and knocked, then her vision went dark as she fell to the ground unconscious.\n\nThe door opened shortly. The nanny had the shock of her life and quickly picked Sydney up in panic. \"Madam!\"\n\nThe sound of a car driving away was heard downstairs.\n\nSydney regained consciousness after Mrs. Harper gave her first aid.\n\nMrs. Harper had a glass of water and a handful of white pills in her hand. She said, \"Madam, why don't you tell your husband about your condition? If he sympathizes with you because of this, you might...\"\n\nSydney shook her head stubbornly, \"He and I are together because we love each other. I don't want to be pitied.\"\n\nShe took the pills and swallowed them. She closed her eyes and kept silent for a long time, then she said to Mrs. Harper, \"He\u2019s seeing someone else. I want to know who she is. Tell me, is it okay for me to ask his friends?\"\n\n\u2026\n\nMelon, the largest nightclub in Quill City.\n\nMusic was blaring in a VIP room. Lorenzo kicked the door open and went in. The men who were dancing intimately with the women almost soiled their pants.\n\nHowever, no one dared to be angry.\n\nLorenzo was a peculiar legend in Quill City. In his youth, he was an uncivilized and rebellious devil. Despite being a member of the Bailey Group, the wealthiest corporation in Quill City, he was cast out as the black sheep of the family and was dead broke.\n\nLater, his parents could not stand it anymore and made a plan for him to study abroad. He refused without hesitation. Instead, he relied on the prize money he got from a gaming tournament and simply enrolled himself in a vocational school.\n\nSuch a self-destructive person suddenly changed at the age of twenty.\n\nLorenzo became extremely hard-working. He diligently went to class and hung out in the library. He would also dress up and leave the dormitory at around six o'clock every morning. He rode the bicycle for an hour to Quill City Fine Arts Academy for lectures.\n\nSome people claimed that he had fallen in love with a student from Quill City Fine Arts Academy.\n\nNot long after, he wanted to start a company. His family was not supportive, of course. So, he put a knife to Grandpa Bailey\u2019s throat and grabbed 300 million to open a jewelry company, registered as Cherr.y.\n\nAt that time, the Baileys thought that the 300 million was burned for good. However, Cherr.y turned out to be unexpectedly successful. It made ten times the profit in its second year. In the fourth year, it was listed in Newford.\n\nToday, the \u2018Black Sheep\u2019 was a self-made man and had become the heir to the Bailey Group. Cherr.y had become a world-renowned jewelry brand.\n\nAs soon as Lorenzo sat down on the sofa, a group of beauties quickly came over and said, \"Mr. Bailey!\"\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nThe women trembled in fright and scurried away. Two more men sat down and said, \"Lorenzo, what pissed you off at home?\"\n\nLorenzo kept quiet. He picked up a glass and started chugging.\n\nThe others did not say anything anymore. They picked up their glass to drink with him.\n\nNot a moment later, someone's cell phone rang on the table.\n\n\"Xavier, your phone!\"\n\nA handsome man with platinum blond hair sat up on the sofa in a dark hidden corner.\n\nXavier woke up from his nap and scratched his tattooed neck. He took a look at his cell phone and his eyes widened.\n\n\"Lorenzo,\" he looked at Lorenzo, \"Why is Sydney calling me?\"\n\nLorenzo paused mid-drink and looked at Xavier. \"Who?\"\n\nXavier walked up to him with his cell phone, \"Your wife!\"\n\nLorenzo's expression turned sinister. \"When did you get her number?\"\n\nXavier said casually, \"On the day you both got married, I gave her my number when we sang together in the karaoke bar.\"\n\nHearing that, Lorenzo stood up abruptly and grabbed Xavier's collar, \"Who asked you to give your number?\"\n\nXavier frowned, puzzled at his friend\u2019s sudden rage. He pushed Lorenzo's hand away, \"We were all having fun, what\u2019s the big deal in exchanging contact information?\"\n\nLorenzo got angry. \"WHY\"\n\nWith that, he punched the undefended Xavier.\n\nXavier was caught off guard and slammed onto the marble table. The wine and glasses on the table clattered onto the floor.\n\nThe atmosphere froze. Lorenzo's eyes turned red like a furious beast. He growled, \"Delete her number!\"\n\nXavier was no sitting duck either. He was the second generation of the Altmans, an old money family in Quill City.  He was the prodigal son of the Altmans, a notorious troublemaker. He could hang out frequently with Lorenzo because they were similar.\n\nXavier wiped the bleeding corner of his lips and punched Lorenzo in return. \"What's going on, Popeye? Use your words, not your fists!\"\n\nLorenzo was hit on the head. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then he grabbed Xavier, pressed him on the sofa and beat him in a frenzy. \"How many times have you contacted Sydney in the past two years?!!\"\n\nXavier dodged Lorenzo's heavy punches and said, \"Why would I contact your wife like I have nothing else to do?! Have you gone mad? I'll admit you to the mental hospital!\"\n\nThese words seemed to hit a nerve. Lorenzo paused. \n\nHe was stunned for a few seconds. Then, he sat down on the side and then closed his eyes to quell the anger in his heart.\n\nXavier sat up, frowned and rubbed his shoulders. Vulgarities spewed.\n\nLorenzo ignored Xavier. After a while, he calmed down. He opened his eagle eyes and scanned the other men in the room, \"Who else saved her number?\"\n\nImmediately, several men lowered their heads to look for their phones.\n\nLorenzo was startled.\n\nImmediately, terrifying sounds of broken bottles filled the space, as well as Lorenzo's angry swear words, and screams of women as they dodge shards of glass.\n\nLorenzo seemed to have lost his mind and started attacking all his friends.\n\nXavier stepped outside with his cell phone and returned Sydney\u2019s call.\n\nWhen Sydney picked up, Xavier humbly said, \"Hi, Sydney. What's the matter?\"\n\nSydney's voice was gentle and polite. \"Xavier, I'm sorry to bother you. Lorenzo got a little upset with me tonight. He blocked me and I can't contact him. I wanted to ask if you know where he is.\"\n\nChapter 0003\n\"He was drinking with me, and now he's drunk and acting crazy. I'll send him back to you later. Don\u2019t worry.\"\n\nSydney paused for a moment then said, \"Can you give me the address? I want to check on him myself.\"\n\nXavier took a deep breath, opened the door and saw the chaos inside. He said, \"Melon, A.\"\n\nAbout ten minutes later, apart from Lorenzo and Xavier, everyone else left.\n\nLorenzo sat on the sofa. He stared at the chandelier on the ceiling, lost in thoughts.\n\nXavier sat next to him, \"We are not a part of your drama with Sydney. If anything, go home and solve it with her. Don't go crazy here.\"\n\nLorenzo closed his eyes. \"I\u2019m not going home.\"\n\n\"You must,\" \"Then tell me what happened between you two, I\u2019ll find a way for you.\"\n\nLorenzo, \"You can't.\"\n\n\u201cFine,\" Xavier said, \"If you won't go home, where will you go later?\"\n\n\"Chelsea will pick me up.\"\n\nXavier was stunned for a moment. \"Are you okay? You got so anxious when your wife called me. And now you\u2019re going to see another woman?\n\n\"I met you late. I don't know what happened between you and Sydney. You left her alone for two years, acting like you really don't care. However, we are not allowed to keep her contact information. What on earth are you thinking?\"\n\nLorenzo became impatient again. \"Boy, don\u2019t meddle with adult matters.\"\n\nWhen Xavier started to curse, a creaking sound came from the door. The two of them looked towards the door.\n\n\u201cEnzo,\u201d A sweet voice came.\n\nThe woman had the body of a devil and the face of an angel as she slithered in. She was the \u2018Nation\u2019s Goddess\u2019 and top tier actress, Chelsea Dune.\n \nLorenzo's expression finally softened a little when she appeared. \"Here she comes.\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows subtly.\n\nChelsea elegantly sat next to Lorenzo while avoiding the mess on the ground. She saw the cut at the corner of his eye.\n\nThe woman frowned. \"Why are you hurt?\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"It's nothing. I just drank too much.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt?\" As she spoke, Chelsea reached out and took Lorenzo's arm.\n\nXavier said with a smile, \"Hey Superstar, do you know he is married?\"\n\nChelsea paused and retracted her hand in embarrassment. \"Enzo and I are just friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, cool.\"\n\nLorenzo seemed displeased with Xavier's sarcasm towards Chelsea. He retorted, \"What are you trying to say?\"\n\nXavier stuck his tongue in his cheek and stood up with a grin. \"Nothing. Things among you guys are too complicated for my little brain. I\u2019m gonna go home to bed.\"\n\nAs soon as Xavier reached the door, the door was opened from the outside.\n\nXavier paused.\n\nSydney stood timidly at the door.\n\nShe was timid but she was objectively eye-catching.\n\nHer long, dark and wavy hair draped casually down her back. She had light makeup on her delicate and pretty face. Her lips were as bright as cherry, with a hint of sparkle.\n\nThe velvet, burgundy strappy dress contrasted with her flawless, snow-white skin. She was like a blooming red rose in the dark night.\n\nXavier gulped. He forgot how to speak at that moment.\n\nLorenzo's voice was suddenly heard. \"Who\u2019s there?\"\n\nXavier was stunned,and stepped aside to make way for Sydney. After Sydney entered the room, he exhaled and came back to his senses.\n\nAs soon as Sydney reached the door, she froze.\n\nEveryone had left. The private room had the brightest lights turned on. Right in the middle, Lorenzo and Chelsea were sitting together with their arms touching each other. To Sydney, that scene hurt her eyes more than the light.\n\nHer breath was stuck in her throat. Her lips quivered, but she could not say a word.\n\nLorenzo had an affair with Chelsea, her college bully!\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Lorenzo frowned, \"Go back!\"\n\nSydney shuddered then finally took a step. She quickened her pace.\n\nShe went up to the two of them. While everyone was caught off guard, she slapped Chelsea across the face and grabbed her hair. \"It's you!\"\n\nChelsea screamed, \"Ah! Enzo, help me!\"\n\n\u201cSydney!\u201d\n\nWhen Lorenzo spoke, Sydney let go of Chelsea. She raised her hand towards Lorenzo, but did not strike him.\n\nHer hands trembled. She broke down and shouted, \"You clearly know what she did to me back then! Of all the people, why her?!\"\n\nSuddenly.\n\nSlap!\n\nChelsea took advantage when Sydney was unguarded and slapped her back. That slap was even harder than Sydney\u2019s.\n\nSydney felt ringing in her ears, and then blood dripped from the corners of her lips.\n\nChelsea snarled, \"Why blame others if you can't keep your man?!\"\n\nSydney held her face. Her eyes turned red at Chelsea\u2019s smug expression. She shouted, \"I'm taking your life. \n\nShe tried to attack Chelsea again, but Lorenzo stopped her. He grabbed the back of her head and threw her to the other side of the sofa.\n\n\"I told you to go back, are you deaf?\"\n\nSydney felt as if she had gone deaf. The ringing in her ears was so severe that she couldn't hear what Lorenzo said. Half of her head was throbbing.\n\nAt this moment, Chelsea suddenly covered her ears and wailed, \"Enzo, I can't hear!\"\n\nLorenzo was shocked, \"You can\u2019t hear?\"\n\nChelsea's eyes widened in pity, and her cries became louder. \"I can't hear what you said...\"\n\nLorenzo looked back and glared at Sydney fiercely. He stood up, arms over Chelsea and walked out, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier, saw Lorenzo escorting a tearful Chelsea out of the room. He knew something was amiss and quickly entered the room.\n\nSydney closed her eyes and clasped her head with her hands. She fell sideways on the sofa. Her shoulders shook.\n\nAt the moment, half of that bright and charming face was as pale as paper, and the other half was marked with an angry palm print. The blood on the corners of her lips stood out even more.\n\nXavier's eyes widened and he rushed over. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney did not respond.\n\nXavier nudged her gently. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney then opened her eyes, her voice fading away, \"My, my ears hurt...\"\n\nWith the slap mark and her ear hurting, Xavier immediately understood what had happened. He helped Sydney up and said, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\nSydney only managed to take two steps before her legs gave way. She was about to crash.\n\nPeople lose strength when they cannot bear the pain. Sydney would rather die than have Lorenzo cheated on her with Chelsea.\n\nXavier felt a pang of distress. He carried Sydney in his arms and hurried out.\n\n\u2026\n\nLorenzo and Chelsea stopped outside the main entrance of Melon. He said, \"Wait for me here, I'll get the car.\"\n\nChelsea held him and said, \"Enzo, I'm better now. I don\u2019t think I need to go to the hospital. Come with me and stay with me, okay?\"\n\nLorenzo frowned, and just as he was about to agree, something behind Chelsea attracted his attention.\n\nXavier carried Sydney and walked quickly towards the parking lot.\n\nLorenzo frowned, \"Since you don't need to go to the hospital, you should go back to the hotel first.\"\n\nWith that, he turned to chase after Xavier, but Chelsea pulled him back. \"Are you going to look for Sydney? How could she treat you like that but you still can't let her go?\"\n\nChapter 0004\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He did not answer and strode after Xavier.\n\nChelsea exhaled forcefully. Her shoulders trembled. She looked at Sydney and Xavier with clear hatred and jealousy.\n\nHowever, Lorenzo did not manage to intercept Xavier. When he passed by, Xavier's car drifted gorgeously before merging onto the main freeway.\n\n\u2026\n\nInside the car.\n\nSydney crumpled into a ball and leaned against the car window. Xavier fastened the seat belt for her.\n\nTears streamed down her face the whole time, but she was expressionless, like a soulless sculpture.\n\nThe pain in her ear strained the nerves across her head, and pulled out many memories that she did not want to recall.\n\nA group of heavily made-up girls surrounded her. The proudest one leading the pack, was Chelsea, the one with the harmless face.\n\nHer smile was pure evil. She pulled Sydney\u2019s hair, and let her companions take turns to slap her. Chelsea dripped melted white ice cream on Sydney\u2019s face and chest.\n\nSydney dared not resist because her grandmother, Mary Collins, was in the hands of Christopher, Chelsea's father.\n\nThe Dunes were quite wealthy. Christopher owned a ceramics company, and Mary used to work as a cleaner in Christopher\u2019s office building.\n\nMary had always done a good job, but that day Chelsea insisted that Mary accidentally destroyed her father's documents. Even a fool knew that it was all a farce.\n\nSydney was a freshman that year and Chelsea was a sophomore.\n\nAt the Quill City Fine Arts Academy, Chelsea had always been the most sought-after goddess by many in the school. After Sydney entered the school, she stole Chelsea\u2019s glory.\n\nJealousy was written all over Chelsea's innocent face.\n\nChelsea took those humiliating photos and made Sydney look cheap. Soon, other people's harsh words tormented her as well.\n\nSydney, you are so pretty. If You planned turns a resentful woman,would your grandma still need to be a cleaner in her old age to support the family?\n\n\"Sydney! Hey, Sydney!\"\n\nXavier's words pulled her back from her thoughts.\n\nShe turned her head blankly to be met with a pair of gentle, concerned eyes.\n\nXavier saw her motionless and thought she had died with her eyes wide open.\n\nThe speed of the car was fast, and the pressure on her back felt comfortable. Sydney took the pills earlier and felt better because her discomfort was suppressed. Her ears still hurt but she could hear clearly.\n\n\"Xavier, thank you.\"\n\nXavier breathed out, \"As long as you're fine.\"\n\nSydney continued to be silent.\n\nIt was already four o'clock in the middle of the night. There were very few cars on the road.\n\nAfter Xavier turned a corner, he looked back at her.\n\nHis Adam's apple rolled quietly once more.\n\nSydney looked bright and charming from the front, but she looked even more striking with her smooth facial outline and high nose from the side. Her thick eyelashes were naturally curled; It felt like she was God\u2019s favorite.\n\nSydney stood out even among beauties and was considered stunning. She was spotted by a talent scout when she hit puberty in her first year of high school.\n\nHowever, her mother refused to allow her to enter the entertainment industry, so she had been keeping her head down at school. Initially, her mother had strict requirements. Sydney was not allowed to have long hair or wear nice clothes.\n\nThroughout high school, she had ugly short hair and wore puffy, outdated and tacky clothes. She was bullied when she started dressing up in college. It was not until she fell in love with that Black Sheep Enzo that she began to step out of her shell because she had someone to protect her.\n\nXavier broke the silence in the car again. \"You knew that all the boys have only known Lorenzo in the past three or four years. Am I right to say that you and Lorenzo have known each other for a long time?\"\n\nWith that, Sydney said, \"Yeah, he was my first love. I dated him when I was a freshman. He stayed with me throughout my college days for four years. We broke up when I graduated...\"\n\n\"After two years of separation, the elders in our respective families crossed paths by accident, and they arranged for us to get married for some reason. I was willing to get married, but he was not.\"\n\nXavier frowned. \"Do you...love him very much?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Sydney\u2019s voice trembled again, \"He used to be... very good to me. Extremely good.\"\n\nShe was deeply caught up by their love, whereby a simple sentence could dig up those heavy and profound memories.\n\n\"I don't have a father. Lorenzo not only gave me the sense of security that a boyfriend should, but he was protective like a father.\n\n\"For every holiday, others are picked up by their parents, but Lorenzo picked me up. At every start of the school season, parents would send their kids to class, but Lorenzo would send me. The day before school started, he would help me check my luggage. He would make sure I had everything I needed. He would also secretly put money into the pockets of my clothes.\u201d\n\nSydney's tears rolled down her cheeks again as she recalled those memories.\n\nXavier tightened his grip on the steering wheel. His expression became heavy. He did not expect Lorenzo to have such a tender and considerate side.\n\nHowever, tenderness and consideration were the most fearful things in a relationship because trying to move on after a breakup was tantamount to chipping away at the bones.\n\nAfter a moment, Xavier spoke, \"You are now... relying on his past kindness to you to support your marriage.\"\n\nThis sentence summed up her lonely married life for the past two years. Sydney lifted her hand and wiped her eyes, \"I am not willing to lose him. We were so good together; I really can't accept the current situation...\"\n   \n\nXavier said, \"But Sydney, have you ever thought about it? Many couples who have been estranged were once deeply in love in the past. You\u2019ve been tormenting yourself by living in the past. You will definitely meet a man who treats you better in the future.\"\n\nSydney sobbed, \"I tried moving on, but I still can't get over...\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows and changed his approach. \"Chelsea hit you, but he took Chelsea away without concern for you. Can you bear it?\"\n\nSydney was stunned for a moment. The hidden deep affection in her eyes was immediately replaced by hatred as her emotions flared up.\n\n\"No, I told Lorenzo from the start that anyone who is friends with Chelsea is my enemy. Did Lorenzo really have feelings for Chelsea, or did he do it deliberately to spite me...\n\n\"No, I can't think like that either,\" she began to mumble through her chaotic thoughts, \"No matter what his purpose is, if he really slept with Chelsea...\"\n\nShe did not continue, but closed her eyes and began to take deep breaths.\n\nSome scenes were just fantasies, but enough to suffocate her.\n\nXavier's heart ached a little when he saw Sydney in pain. At the same time, he was also curious about what happened between Sydney and Chelsea.\n\nJust as he was about to ask, his cell phone, which he had thrown inside the armrest storage, rang.\n\nHe looked down. It was a call from Lorenzo.\n\nXavier frowned, turned over his phone and clicked to hang up. He glanced in the rearview mirror again.\n\nBehind him was a flashy, black and red car, the world\u2019s rarest supercar. A toy owned by the richest man in Quill City.\n\nXavier looked at Sydney again. Her sobs could really melt a man's heart. He secretly gripped the steering wheel.\n\nIt was not Sydney who gave him her number first. The men, including him, noticed Lorenzo's indifference towards her, but were too captivated by her beauty, so they asked for it behind Lorenzo's back.\n\nOf course, they all found a perfect reason. They asked Sydney to leave her number, so they could contact her for business purposes.\n\nAt that time, no one dared to have filthy intentions. She was Lorenzo's legal wife, and Lorenzo was one of the most outstanding people among his friends.\n\nAside from the fact that Sydney was married, she was indeed a rare beauty. Everyone thought it was harmless to keep a beautiful woman\u2019s phone number.\n\nHowever, things were different now.\n\nHe swerved the steering wheel abruptly and turned around in the opposite direction. He accelerated to 200 miles an hour, and threw Lorenzo off his trail.\n\nChapter 0005\nXavier was driving dangerously fast, but his expression was exceptionally calm.\n\nIn addition to running several companies, he was also a part-time F2 racing driver.\n\nFor Lorenzo, the supercar was just a means of transportation, but in Xavier's hands, it was a toy. He was sure that Lorenzo would not be able to catch up.\n\nLorenzo watched Xavier's car zoom by his car like a ghost. He was stunned for a moment and quickly turned around. Two minutes later, he lost them.\n\nHe continued to call Xavier while flooring the accelerator, but still no one answered.\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier knew that he had other intentions when he ditched Lorenzo, but he dared not show it in front of Sydney right away.\n\nAfter all, she was still Lorenzo's wife. Xavier was one year younger than Lorenzo whom he regarded as his blood brother, so she was his sister-in-law, in a sense.\n\nHe took her to the hospital as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter the medical check-up to make sure there were no major problems, Xavier took Sydney back to Celestial Park after applying ice patches to her face.\n\nCelestial Park was a famous luxury residential area in Quill City. Sydney and Lorenzo bought their marital home here.\n\nAs soon as Sydney got to the bedroom, she saw Lorenzo sitting on the sofa at the end of the bed. There was a bottle of white wine on the round table next to him.\n\nSydney's eyes flashed. Without saying a word, she went to bed, lay down, and closed her eyes.\n\nA few seconds later, the man's footsteps were heard.\n\nSydney shivered. Her eyelashes became wet again.\n\nLorenzo suddenly got on the bed and pressed on her. She opened her eyes and started to push him away. \"Don't touch me...\"\n\nLorenzo paused, grabbed her collar with both hands, and tore her skirt apart.\n\nSydney's eyes widened with shock. Her screams echoed through the bedroom. \"Don't touch me with the hand you used to touch Chelsea Dune!\"\n\nLorenzo froze.\n\nSydney looked at him as tears poured down her face. \"I can have no dignity in front of you because we were dependent on each other for those four years. You provided a great deal for me, and you are also the closest person to me besides my mother and grandmother. My heart breaks for you because you were hurt by what happened back then. I can\u2019t bear to see you in deep pain every day because of me so I allow you to vent your grievances by hurting me!\n\n\u201cBut I can't share the same man with Chelsea, and I can't have the hand that touched her, touch me!!\n\n\u201cShe is the last straw of my dignity, Lorenzo!\"\n\nHowever, these words did not move Lorenzo to show any guilt.\n\nInstead, he became angrier. \"What about my last straw?\"\n\n\"I was disgusted by you too after Oliver touched you. What you do that night when we got registered?\"\n  \nSydney trembled. She choked.\n\nThat night.\n  \nHer mother and mother-in-law both wanted to seize the opportunity so that she and Lorenzo could have a child as soon as possible, so they tampered with their tea.\n\nLorenzo thought it was Sydney who Framed him.\n\n\"Why aren't you talking?\" Lorenzo's eyes were red as he stared into hers, \"Where did Xavier take you? He deliberately didn't answer my call. What did you do?\"\n\n\"Can you stop being suspicious of everyone and anyone? He took me to the hospital!\"\n\n\"Hospital?\" Lorenzo sneered, and he tightened his grip on her clothes, this time tearing her skirt all the way, \"Sydney, lift your legs for me!\"\n\nSydney panicked. \"What are you going to do?!\"\n\n\"Let's see if you betrayed me again!\"\n\nSydney immediately closed her knees together, \"I didn't!\"\n\nLorenzo pressed harder and his voice became more forceful, \"I don't believe a word you said!\"\n\nSuch stubborn words made Sydney lose the will to refute him.\n\nShe looked at Lorenzo\u2019s frightening and gloomy face and felt disgusted with him for the first time.\n\nShe reached out and pinched the back of his hand. \"Let me go, I'm tired, I want to sleep!\"\n\n\"I don't want to sleep, why should you sleep!\" Lorenzo was still furious. He did not seem to feel any pain in the back of his hand. The grip in his hand became stronger and stronger.\n\nHe pulled apart Sydney's knees quickly. He spread her legs apart so hard that even her behinds hurt.\n\nHe was worried that she would resist, so he pressed his knee on her belly and untied his belt.\n\nSydney's tears rolled to the side of her temples and wet the pillow. Still, she said nothing. Since pinching the back of his hand did not work, she pinched his neck hard.\n\nLorenzo winced in pain, but still did not let her go.\n\nIt felt as if he would not give up if he did not test her.\n\nLorenzo's neck,and even his arms and abdominal muscles were left bruised from Sydney's pinching while she gradually lost hope.\n\nShe wilted like dry roses, losing all trace of vitality.\n\nLorenzo endured the pain and tried to control her, but failed.\n\nSydney's tearful eyes trembled. Her hand squeezing his chest loosened, and she finally spoke again, \"Is that enough?\"\n\n\"Enough?\" Unexpectedly, Lorenzo felt even more enraged. He reached out and yanked open the drawer on the bedside table, took out the bottle of essential oil she bought, and then slammed the drawer shut!\n\nSydney seized this opportunity and tried to escape, but he grabbed her ankle in time. \"Be good!\"\n\nSydney stopped resisting. She knew she would not be able to escape tonight.\n\nShe was in tears, but she laughed. \"Lorenzo, I really didn't expect that one day I would be disgusted with you. Go ahead, disgust me more. So I can hate you enough, and give you what you want...\"\n\nShe thought, \u2018Lorenzo should know what I was referring to.\u2019\n\nIn the split second, her refusal to sign the divorce agreement suddenly wavered.\n\nDuring the time between being taken away by Xavier and being sent back home, she had been recalling the past.\n\nWhen she recalled the past with Chelsea, she did not want to lose her self-esteem. However, when she recalled every moment with Lorenzo, she did not want to regret losing the man she loved most.\n\nShe was deeply confused by these opposing feelings.\n\nHowever, right now, she actually felt disgusted with the man she loved most.\n\nShe was glad.\n\nDisgusted by him meant that she could finally let him go one day. \n\nLorenzo's face darkened at Sydney\u2019s words. He could not tell whether he was angry or something else.\n\nShe wanted to say more, but Lorenzo's lips suddenly covered hers.\n\nAt the same time, his fingertips of both hands trailed up along her waistline.\n\nThe faint smell of tobacco mixed with the fragrance and wine was an alluring masculine aroma. In the past, she could never resist his kisses.\n\nLorenzo was even wilder in the past than he is now. He was like a lion in the savanna. The passion and impulse he made her feel was strong and without restraint.\n\nApart from the four years they were separated, they had slept together for four years until now. He understood every part of her body, her preferred tension and pressure.\n\nSoon, her body reacted uncontrollably."

                      "text": "Chapter 0001\nIt was ten o'clock in the evening. Sydney Castro sat in front of the dressing table, rubbing essential oils on her body for that glowing skin.\n\nClearly, she was getting ready to please a man.\n\nHer husband, whom she had not seen for two years, was returning to Somerland today. She missed him terribly.\n\nSydney oiled every part of her body until she was soft and smooth. Then she put on a white, furry lingerie set with a cheeky little cat tail on the small of her back.\n\nIn truth, she did not have to go to such trouble in the past. Lorenzo had wished he could stick to her every day, but after that fateful day, everything changed.\n\nShe went from being his closest lover to the woman he hated the most.\n\nLater, their elders arranged for them to get married. However, Lorenzo was so reluctant that he left the country the day after signing their marriage certificate.\n\nNow two years have passed, during which he only contacted her once. It was six months after her mother's death that he sent her a divorce agreement.\n\nSydney did not sign the papers. She still harbored thoughts of rekindling her marriage with Lorenzo.\n\nHowever, it was difficult.\n\nShe was not even aware he was returning tonight. She only found out when she saw Lorenzo\u2019s friends posted about their drinking session on social media.\n\nLater, she called her mother-in-law, who helped her and sent a driver to bring Lorenzo back.\n\nThe driver called. Lorenzo would be home in a few minutes.\n\nShe had to seize this opportunity and try to rekindle their old flame again.\n\nIntentionally dressed up, she knelt on fours by the bed, evenly distributing the rose petals that had been sprinkled on the bed in advance. She was so engrossed that she did not notice a long shadow walking in.\n\nSuddenly, Sydney\u2019s cat tail was yanked hard as a hot-blooded torso pressed on her back. Her heart skipped a beat. She turned back and came face-to-face with a deep yet intense set of piercing eyes.\n\n\"Enzo...\" she began delicately, \"You finally came...\" Back.\n\nThe rest of her sentence was choked back by a kiss reeking of ethanol.\n\nSydney's eyelashes fluttered as her body responded to his. She was not sure whether Lorenzo was drunk or if her outfit tonight was a success. \n\nLorenzo kissed her so passionately that he wanted to suck her lips swollen. He placed his hands over her waist , grabbing them vigorously.\n\nThe man seemed satisfied. While taking a breath, he growled in a whisper. \"good...\"\n\nGrowling in a whisper was considered flirting. That was Lorenzo\u2019s special habit. \n\nRecently, she had been doing yoga. Her figure was way better than two years ago. This was also a surprise for Lorenzo. His words and actions ignited the fire in her heart.\n\nHer plump waist rose and fell violently. Her rapid breath escaped her rosy lips. Her glowy, fair hands explored his waist through his custom silk shirt, caressing his hard and steamy muscles for the first time in a long time. She hurriedly unbuttoned his shirt.\n\nThe smooth material slid down his strong arms. She unbuckled his belt and wrapped her legs around his waist.\n\nEight years of familiarity with each other made them very compatible in bed. No need for any fluff, they went straight into it.\n\nPerhaps it was because they had not seen each other for too long. His desire seemed to be even more intense than hers, just like when he first tasted the forbidden fruit eight years ago. The man was excited and tireless.\n\nThis went on for more than three hours. Finally, he was satisfied.\n\nSydney laid on the man's beautiful sculpted chest and kissed his handsome face obsessively, trying to make up for lost time.\n\nLorenzo kept his eyes closed, allowing her kisses.\n\n \"I'm very pleased with you tonight.\"Lorenzo said\n\nSydney smiled and kissed the corner of his lips again.\n\nLorenzo raised the corners of his lips. He grabbed her waist hard, and turned over to hold her down.\n\nSydney was sure that he was in a good mood now.\n\nShe stretched out her hand to rub his Adam's apple. Right before they did it again, she said bluntly, \"Enzo, four years ago\u2026I swear nothing happened between Oliver and I. My body and soul completely belong to you. You are finally back. Can we please forget what happened that day and move forward together?\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the smile on the man's face froze instantly.\n\nLorenzo raised his hand and grabbed Sydney\u2019s throat. \n\nSydney's heart skipped a beat. She widened her eyes in panic. It was over. She had said the wrong thing.\n\nThis happened twice before. If she mentioned the words \"four years ago\", Lorenzo would immediately become ruthless and sinister.\n\nHer best friend once said that Lorenzo's reaction was akin to PTSD, a post-traumatic stress reaction.\n\nShe had doubts at the time, and it turned out to be the same today, which proved that her best friend was right.\n\nIn a daze, she heard Lorenzo say, \"Move forward with me? You?\n\n\"I touched you tonight because I'm afraid that you,  wouldn\u2019t change your disgusting habit and sleep with my friends again!\"\n\n\"I won't, I didn\u2019t...\" Sydney explained and reached out to touch his hand, attempting to soothe him.\n\nLorenzo's hand tightened, \"Don't touch me!\"\n\nSydney's face was red from Lorenzo\u2019s grip on her throat.\n\nLorenzo took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. \"You'd better sign the divorce agreement as soon as possible. The past love we had will never be rekindled.\"\n\n The words \u2018divorce agreement\u2019 stabbed Sydney\u2019s heart like a sword. She looked up anxiously, and said with difficulty, \"We were so good back then. Are you going to completely deny all that I\u2019ve done for you, just because of that incident?\n\n\"Oliver and I both explained back then that nothing happened to us. We were set up!\"\n\nHowever, the more she explained, the angrier Lorenzo became. His hand went up her neck and grabbed her chin. The force in his grip became stronger and stronger. Sydney could feel that he wanted to crush her chin.\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\nHe ignored her cries of pain.\n\n\"Set up? Lying on the same bed with him might be a set up, but what about the child in your belly?\"\n\n\"Sydney, I wanted so badly for that baby to be mine at that time... But all the hospitals we went to in Quill City showed the same result: You were fifteen days conceived a baby.!\n\n\"I was on a business trip for two months and you were fifteen days conceived a baby. How could you make me believe that nothing happened between you and him?!\"\n\nAfter that, Lorenzo shook her off.\n\nSydney fell on the pillow. She straightened her messy hair, stood up again and explained shakily, \"But the first doctor I consulted was a traditional medicine practitioner. The old doctor said that I was two months conceived a baby. I didn't tell you immediately because I wanted to wait for you to come back to give you a surprise!\n\n\"You\u2019ve met that old doctor too. He showed you the prescription he gave me with the time written on it. Why won't you...\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Lorenzo interrupted her, \"Handwritten time has no credibility, and it's easier to bribe an old traditional medicine practitioner. Stop now and shut up!\"\n\nShe stood in his shoes and could understand the hurt in his heart. However, she still felt heartbroken from how he decisively shunned her.\n\nEspecially their child. The rejection was heartbreakingly painful.\n\nShe knew it was useless to say anything, so she kept quiet and shed tears of frustration.\n\nLorenzo got out of bed and made a phone call.\n\nThe room was quiet. As the call connected, Sydney heard the voice on the other end. She quickly got out of bed.\n\nA woman\u2019s voice. \"Mr. Bailey\u2026\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"Are you still here?\"\n\nWoman, \"Yes, do you want to come over?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lorenzo said and hung up the phone. \n\nSydney held him back. Her eyes widened with tears and her voice trembled. \"Are you seeing someone else?\"\n\nChapter 0002\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\nSydney\u2019s world collapsed as she burst into tears. \"When did it happen?! Who is she?!\"\n\nShe looked utterly miserable now. Lorenzo had no mercy, he might have even felt a little pleasure seeing her in pain.\n\n\"Can\u2019t stand seeing me with someone else?\"\n\nYes, she could not stand it.\n\nLoving a person would inherently make one possessive. Lorenzo meant so much to her that she could not accept losing him.\n\nAt this moment, the way she was just speechlessly hyperventilating due to the blow was more pathetic than crying. It felt like she was falling to pieces.\n\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He got dressed and left the bedroom.\n\nSydney refused to give up and chased after him. \"Why won\u2019t you believe that I was set up?\"\n\nLorenzo stopped and turned around. \"Then tell me, who set you up?\"\n\nThe corridor of the mansion was wide and long. Sydney was speechless as she looked at the lanky man in white shirt and trousers.    \n\nFour years ago, they talked about this many times. Each time they got stuck here.\n\nExactly.\n\nShe still did not find out who did it.\n\nThe setup was extremely vicious.\n\nLorenzo and Sydney\u2019s relationship turned from true love to pure hatred. They were so miserable for each other that it broke apart Lorenzo and Oliver\u2019s friendship. It also caused Sydney to become mentally ill, miscarrying from extreme heartache...\n\nHowever, she still could not identify the mastermind behind this! Four years ago, Sydney and Oliver searched for a long time but to no avail.\n\nLorenzo left.\n\nSydney stood in the corridor for a long time. She clutched her chest and raced towards the room at the corner of the corridor, calling out with each step, \"Mrs. Harper...\"\n\nHer breath became shorter each time.\n\nWhen she reached the door, she reached out and knocked, then her vision went dark as she fell to the ground unconscious.\n\nThe door opened shortly. The nanny had the shock of her life and quickly picked Sydney up in panic. \"Madam!\"\n\nThe sound of a car driving away was heard downstairs.\n\nSydney regained consciousness after Mrs. Harper gave her first aid.\n\nMrs. Harper had a glass of water and a handful of white pills in her hand. She said, \"Madam, why don't you tell your husband about your condition? If he sympathizes with you because of this, you might...\"\n\nSydney shook her head stubbornly, \"He and I are together because we love each other. I don't want to be pitied.\"\n\nShe took the pills and swallowed them. She closed her eyes and kept silent for a long time, then she said to Mrs. Harper, \"He\u2019s seeing someone else. I want to know who she is. Tell me, is it okay for me to ask his friends?\"\n\n\u2026\n\nMelon, the largest nightclub in Quill City.\n\nMusic was blaring in a VIP room. Lorenzo kicked the door open and went in. The men who were dancing intimately with the women almost soiled their pants.\n\nHowever, no one dared to be angry.\n\nLorenzo was a peculiar legend in Quill City. In his youth, he was an uncivilized and rebellious devil. Despite being a member of the Bailey Group, the wealthiest corporation in Quill City, he was cast out as the black sheep of the family and was dead broke.\n\nLater, his parents could not stand it anymore and made a plan for him to study abroad. He refused without hesitation. Instead, he relied on the prize money he got from a gaming tournament and simply enrolled himself in a vocational school.\n\nSuch a self-destructive person suddenly changed at the age of twenty.\n\nLorenzo became extremely hard-working. He diligently went to class and hung out in the library. He would also dress up and leave the dormitory at around six o'clock every morning. He rode the bicycle for an hour to Quill City Fine Arts Academy for lectures.\n\nSome people claimed that he had fallen in love with a student from Quill City Fine Arts Academy.\n\nNot long after, he wanted to start a company. His family was not supportive, of course. So, he put a knife to Grandpa Bailey\u2019s throat and grabbed 300 million to open a jewelry company, registered as Cherr.y.\n\nAt that time, the Baileys thought that the 300 million was burned for good. However, Cherr.y turned out to be unexpectedly successful. It made ten times the profit in its second year. In the fourth year, it was listed in Newford.\n\nToday, the \u2018Black Sheep\u2019 was a self-made man and had become the heir to the Bailey Group. Cherr.y had become a world-renowned jewelry brand.\n\nAs soon as Lorenzo sat down on the sofa, a group of beauties quickly came over and said, \"Mr. Bailey!\"\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nThe women trembled in fright and scurried away. Two more men sat down and said, \"Lorenzo, what pissed you off at home?\"\n\nLorenzo kept quiet. He picked up a glass and started chugging.\n\nThe others did not say anything anymore. They picked up their glass to drink with him.\n\nNot a moment later, someone's cell phone rang on the table.\n\n\"Xavier, your phone!\"\n\nA handsome man with platinum blond hair sat up on the sofa in a dark hidden corner.\n\nXavier woke up from his nap and scratched his tattooed neck. He took a look at his cell phone and his eyes widened.\n\n\"Lorenzo,\" he looked at Lorenzo, \"Why is Sydney calling me?\"\n\nLorenzo paused mid-drink and looked at Xavier. \"Who?\"\n\nXavier walked up to him with his cell phone, \"Your wife!\"\n\nLorenzo's expression turned sinister. \"When did you get her number?\"\n\nXavier said casually, \"On the day you both got married, I gave her my number when we sang together in the karaoke bar.\"\n\nHearing that, Lorenzo stood up abruptly and grabbed Xavier's collar, \"Who asked you to give your number?\"\n\nXavier frowned, puzzled at his friend\u2019s sudden rage. He pushed Lorenzo's hand away, \"We were all having fun, what\u2019s the big deal in exchanging contact information?\"\n\nLorenzo got angry. \"WHY\"\n\nWith that, he punched the undefended Xavier.\n\nXavier was caught off guard and slammed onto the marble table. The wine and glasses on the table clattered onto the floor.\n\nThe atmosphere froze. Lorenzo's eyes turned red like a furious beast. He growled, \"Delete her number!\"\n\nXavier was no sitting duck either. He was the second generation of the Altmans, an old money family in Quill City.  He was the prodigal son of the Altmans, a notorious troublemaker. He could hang out frequently with Lorenzo because they were similar.\n\nXavier wiped the bleeding corner of his lips and punched Lorenzo in return. \"What's going on, Popeye? Use your words, not your fists!\"\n\nLorenzo was hit on the head. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then he grabbed Xavier, pressed him on the sofa and beat him in a frenzy. \"How many times have you contacted Sydney in the past two years?!!\"\n\nXavier dodged Lorenzo's heavy punches and said, \"Why would I contact your wife like I have nothing else to do?! Have you gone mad? I'll admit you to the mental hospital!\"\n\nThese words seemed to hit a nerve. Lorenzo paused. \n\nHe was stunned for a few seconds. Then, he sat down on the side and then closed his eyes to quell the anger in his heart.\n\nXavier sat up, frowned and rubbed his shoulders. Vulgarities spewed.\n\nLorenzo ignored Xavier. After a while, he calmed down. He opened his eagle eyes and scanned the other men in the room, \"Who else saved her number?\"\n\nImmediately, several men lowered their heads to look for their phones.\n\nLorenzo was startled.\n\nImmediately, terrifying sounds of broken bottles filled the space, as well as Lorenzo's angry swear words, and screams of women as they dodge shards of glass.\n\nLorenzo seemed to have lost his mind and started attacking all his friends.\n\nXavier stepped outside with his cell phone and returned Sydney\u2019s call.\n\nWhen Sydney picked up, Xavier humbly said, \"Hi, Sydney. What's the matter?\"\n\nSydney's voice was gentle and polite. \"Xavier, I'm sorry to bother you. Lorenzo got a little upset with me tonight. He blocked me and I can't contact him. I wanted to ask if you know where he is.\"\n\nChapter 0003\n\"He was drinking with me, and now he's drunk and acting crazy. I'll send him back to you later. Don\u2019t worry.\"\n\nSydney paused for a moment then said, \"Can you give me the address? I want to check on him myself.\"\n\nXavier took a deep breath, opened the door and saw the chaos inside. He said, \"Melon, A.\"\n\nAbout ten minutes later, apart from Lorenzo and Xavier, everyone else left.\n\nLorenzo sat on the sofa. He stared at the chandelier on the ceiling, lost in thoughts.\n\nXavier sat next to him, \"We are not a part of your drama with Sydney. If anything, go home and solve it with her. Don't go crazy here.\"\n\nLorenzo closed his eyes. \"I\u2019m not going home.\"\n\n\"You must,\" \"Then tell me what happened between you two, I\u2019ll find a way for you.\"\n\nLorenzo, \"You can't.\"\n\n\u201cFine,\" Xavier said, \"If you won't go home, where will you go later?\"\n\n\"Chelsea will pick me up.\"\n\nXavier was stunned for a moment. \"Are you okay? You got so anxious when your wife called me. And now you\u2019re going to see another woman?\n\n\"I met you late. I don't know what happened between you and Sydney. You left her alone for two years, acting like you really don't care. However, we are not allowed to keep her contact information. What on earth are you thinking?\"\n\nLorenzo became impatient again. \"Boy, don\u2019t meddle with adult matters.\"\n\nWhen Xavier started to curse, a creaking sound came from the door. The two of them looked towards the door.\n\n\u201cEnzo,\u201d A sweet voice came.\n\nThe woman had the body of a devil and the face of an angel as she slithered in. She was the \u2018Nation\u2019s Goddess\u2019 and top tier actress, Chelsea Dune.\n \nLorenzo's expression finally softened a little when she appeared. \"Here she comes.\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows subtly.\n\nChelsea elegantly sat next to Lorenzo while avoiding the mess on the ground. She saw the cut at the corner of his eye.\n\nThe woman frowned. \"Why are you hurt?\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"It's nothing. I just drank too much.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt?\" As she spoke, Chelsea reached out and took Lorenzo's arm.\n\nXavier said with a smile, \"Hey Superstar, do you know he is married?\"\n\nChelsea paused and retracted her hand in embarrassment. \"Enzo and I are just friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, cool.\"\n\nLorenzo seemed displeased with Xavier's sarcasm towards Chelsea. He retorted, \"What are you trying to say?\"\n\nXavier stuck his tongue in his cheek and stood up with a grin. \"Nothing. Things among you guys are too complicated for my little brain. I\u2019m gonna go home to bed.\"\n\nAs soon as Xavier reached the door, the door was opened from the outside.\n\nXavier paused.\n\nSydney stood timidly at the door.\n\nShe was timid but she was objectively eye-catching.\n\nHer long, dark and wavy hair draped casually down her back. She had light makeup on her delicate and pretty face. Her lips were as bright as cherry, with a hint of sparkle.\n\nThe velvet, burgundy strappy dress contrasted with her flawless, snow-white skin. She was like a blooming red rose in the dark night.\n\nXavier gulped. He forgot how to speak at that moment.\n\nLorenzo's voice was suddenly heard. \"Who\u2019s there?\"\n\nXavier was stunned,and stepped aside to make way for Sydney. After Sydney entered the room, he exhaled and came back to his senses.\n\nAs soon as Sydney reached the door, she froze.\n\nEveryone had left. The private room had the brightest lights turned on. Right in the middle, Lorenzo and Chelsea were sitting together with their arms touching each other. To Sydney, that scene hurt her eyes more than the light.\n\nHer breath was stuck in her throat. Her lips quivered, but she could not say a word.\n\nLorenzo had an affair with Chelsea, her college bully!\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Lorenzo frowned, \"Go back!\"\n\nSydney shuddered then finally took a step. She quickened her pace.\n\nShe went up to the two of them. While everyone was caught off guard, she slapped Chelsea across the face and grabbed her hair. \"It's you!\"\n\nChelsea screamed, \"Ah! Enzo, help me!\"\n\n\u201cSydney!\u201d\n\nWhen Lorenzo spoke, Sydney let go of Chelsea. She raised her hand towards Lorenzo, but did not strike him.\n\nHer hands trembled. She broke down and shouted, \"You clearly know what she did to me back then! Of all the people, why her?!\"\n\nSuddenly.\n\nSlap!\n\nChelsea took advantage when Sydney was unguarded and slapped her back. That slap was even harder than Sydney\u2019s.\n\nSydney felt ringing in her ears, and then blood dripped from the corners of her lips.\n\nChelsea snarled, \"Why blame others if you can't keep your man?!\"\n\nSydney held her face. Her eyes turned red at Chelsea\u2019s smug expression. She shouted, \"I'm taking your life. \n\nShe tried to attack Chelsea again, but Lorenzo stopped her. He grabbed the back of her head and threw her to the other side of the sofa.\n\n\"I told you to go back, are you deaf?\"\n\nSydney felt as if she had gone deaf. The ringing in her ears was so severe that she couldn't hear what Lorenzo said. Half of her head was throbbing.\n\nAt this moment, Chelsea suddenly covered her ears and wailed, \"Enzo, I can't hear!\"\n\nLorenzo was shocked, \"You can\u2019t hear?\"\n\nChelsea's eyes widened in pity, and her cries became louder. \"I can't hear what you said...\"\n\nLorenzo looked back and glared at Sydney fiercely. He stood up, arms over Chelsea and walked out, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier, saw Lorenzo escorting a tearful Chelsea out of the room. He knew something was amiss and quickly entered the room.\n\nSydney closed her eyes and clasped her head with her hands. She fell sideways on the sofa. Her shoulders shook.\n\nAt the moment, half of that bright and charming face was as pale as paper, and the other half was marked with an angry palm print. The blood on the corners of her lips stood out even more.\n\nXavier's eyes widened and he rushed over. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney did not respond.\n\nXavier nudged her gently. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney then opened her eyes, her voice fading away, \"My, my ears hurt...\"\n\nWith the slap mark and her ear hurting, Xavier immediately understood what had happened. He helped Sydney up and said, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\nSydney only managed to take two steps before her legs gave way. She was about to crash.\n\nPeople lose strength when they cannot bear the pain. Sydney would rather die than have Lorenzo cheated on her with Chelsea.\n\nXavier felt a pang of distress. He carried Sydney in his arms and hurried out.\n\n\u2026\n\nLorenzo and Chelsea stopped outside the main entrance of Melon. He said, \"Wait for me here, I'll get the car.\"\n\nChelsea held him and said, \"Enzo, I'm better now. I don\u2019t think I need to go to the hospital. Come with me and stay with me, okay?\"\n\nLorenzo frowned, and just as he was about to agree, something behind Chelsea attracted his attention.\n\nXavier carried Sydney and walked quickly towards the parking lot.\n\nLorenzo frowned, \"Since you don't need to go to the hospital, you should go back to the hotel first.\"\n\nWith that, he turned to chase after Xavier, but Chelsea pulled him back. \"Are you going to look for Sydney? How could she treat you like that but you still can't let her go?\"\n\nChapter 0004\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He did not answer and strode after Xavier.\n\nChelsea exhaled forcefully. Her shoulders trembled. She looked at Sydney and Xavier with clear hatred and jealousy.\n\nHowever, Lorenzo did not manage to intercept Xavier. When he passed by, Xavier's car drifted gorgeously before merging onto the main freeway.\n\n\u2026\n\nInside the car.\n\nSydney crumpled into a ball and leaned against the car window. Xavier fastened the seat belt for her.\n\nTears streamed down her face the whole time, but she was expressionless, like a soulless sculpture.\n\nThe pain in her ear strained the nerves across her head, and pulled out many memories that she did not want to recall.\n\nA group of heavily made-up girls surrounded her. The proudest one leading the pack, was Chelsea, the one with the harmless face.\n\nHer smile was pure evil. She pulled Sydney\u2019s hair, and let her companions take turns to slap her. Chelsea dripped melted white ice cream on Sydney\u2019s face and chest.\n\nSydney dared not resist because her grandmother, Mary Collins, was in the hands of Christopher, Chelsea's father.\n\nThe Dunes were quite wealthy. Christopher owned a ceramics company, and Mary used to work as a cleaner in Christopher\u2019s office building.\n\nMary had always done a good job, but that day Chelsea insisted that Mary accidentally destroyed her father's documents. Even a fool knew that it was all a farce.\n\nSydney was a freshman that year and Chelsea was a sophomore.\n\nAt the Quill City Fine Arts Academy, Chelsea had always been the most sought-after goddess by many in the school. After Sydney entered the school, she stole Chelsea\u2019s glory.\n\nJealousy was written all over Chelsea's innocent face.\n\nChelsea took those humiliating photos and made Sydney look cheap. Soon, other people's harsh words tormented her as well.\n\nSydney, you are so pretty. If You planned turns a resentful woman,would your grandma still need to be a cleaner in her old age to support the family?\n\n\"Sydney! Hey, Sydney!\"\n\nXavier's words pulled her back from her thoughts.\n\nShe turned her head blankly to be met with a pair of gentle, concerned eyes.\n\nXavier saw her motionless and thought she had died with her eyes wide open.\n\nThe speed of the car was fast, and the pressure on her back felt comfortable. Sydney took the pills earlier and felt better because her discomfort was suppressed. Her ears still hurt but she could hear clearly.\n\n\"Xavier, thank you.\"\n\nXavier breathed out, \"As long as you're fine.\"\n\nSydney continued to be silent.\n\nIt was already four o'clock in the middle of the night. There were very few cars on the road.\n\nAfter Xavier turned a corner, he looked back at her.\n\nHis Adam's apple rolled quietly once more.\n\nSydney looked bright and charming from the front, but she looked even more striking with her smooth facial outline and high nose from the side. Her thick eyelashes were naturally curled; It felt like she was God\u2019s favorite.\n\nSydney stood out even among beauties and was considered stunning. She was spotted by a talent scout when she hit puberty in her first year of high school.\n\nHowever, her mother refused to allow her to enter the entertainment industry, so she had been keeping her head down at school. Initially, her mother had strict requirements. Sydney was not allowed to have long hair or wear nice clothes.\n\nThroughout high school, she had ugly short hair and wore puffy, outdated and tacky clothes. She was bullied when she started dressing up in college. It was not until she fell in love with that Black Sheep Enzo that she began to step out of her shell because she had someone to protect her.\n\nXavier broke the silence in the car again. \"You knew that all the boys have only known Lorenzo in the past three or four years. Am I right to say that you and Lorenzo have known each other for a long time?\"\n\nWith that, Sydney said, \"Yeah, he was my first love. I dated him when I was a freshman. He stayed with me throughout my college days for four years. We broke up when I graduated...\"\n\n\"After two years of separation, the elders in our respective families crossed paths by accident, and they arranged for us to get married for some reason. I was willing to get married, but he was not.\"\n\nXavier frowned. \"Do you...love him very much?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Sydney\u2019s voice trembled again, \"He used to be... very good to me. Extremely good.\"\n\nShe was deeply caught up by their love, whereby a simple sentence could dig up those heavy and profound memories.\n\n\"I don't have a father. Lorenzo not only gave me the sense of security that a boyfriend should, but he was protective like a father.\n\n\"For every holiday, others are picked up by their parents, but Lorenzo picked me up. At every start of the school season, parents would send their kids to class, but Lorenzo would send me. The day before school started, he would help me check my luggage. He would make sure I had everything I needed. He would also secretly put money into the pockets of my clothes.\u201d\n\nSydney's tears rolled down her cheeks again as she recalled those memories.\n\nXavier tightened his grip on the steering wheel. His expression became heavy. He did not expect Lorenzo to have such a tender and considerate side.\n\nHowever, tenderness and consideration were the most fearful things in a relationship because trying to move on after a breakup was tantamount to chipping away at the bones.\n\nAfter a moment, Xavier spoke, \"You are now... relying on his past kindness to you to support your marriage.\"\n\nThis sentence summed up her lonely married life for the past two years. Sydney lifted her hand and wiped her eyes, \"I am not willing to lose him. We were so good together; I really can't accept the current situation...\"\n   \n\nXavier said, \"But Sydney, have you ever thought about it? Many couples who have been estranged were once deeply in love in the past. You\u2019ve been tormenting yourself by living in the past. You will definitely meet a man who treats you better in the future.\"\n\nSydney sobbed, \"I tried moving on, but I still can't get over...\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows and changed his approach. \"Chelsea hit you, but he took Chelsea away without concern for you. Can you bear it?\"\n\nSydney was stunned for a moment. The hidden deep affection in her eyes was immediately replaced by hatred as her emotions flared up.\n\n\"No, I told Lorenzo from the start that anyone who is friends with Chelsea is my enemy. Did Lorenzo really have feelings for Chelsea, or did he do it deliberately to spite me...\n\n\"No, I can't think like that either,\" she began to mumble through her chaotic thoughts, \"No matter what his purpose is, if he really slept with Chelsea...\"\n\nShe did not continue, but closed her eyes and began to take deep breaths.\n\nSome scenes were just fantasies, but enough to suffocate her.\n\nXavier's heart ached a little when he saw Sydney in pain. At the same time, he was also curious about what happened between Sydney and Chelsea.\n\nJust as he was about to ask, his cell phone, which he had thrown inside the armrest storage, rang.\n\nHe looked down. It was a call from Lorenzo.\n\nXavier frowned, turned over his phone and clicked to hang up. He glanced in the rearview mirror again.\n\nBehind him was a flashy, black and red car, the world\u2019s rarest supercar. A toy owned by the richest man in Quill City.\n\nXavier looked at Sydney again. Her sobs could really melt a man's heart. He secretly gripped the steering wheel.\n\nIt was not Sydney who gave him her number first. The men, including him, noticed Lorenzo's indifference towards her, but were too captivated by her beauty, so they asked for it behind Lorenzo's back.\n\nOf course, they all found a perfect reason. They asked Sydney to leave her number, so they could contact her for business purposes.\n\nAt that time, no one dared to have filthy intentions. She was Lorenzo's legal wife, and Lorenzo was one of the most outstanding people among his friends.\n\nAside from the fact that Sydney was married, she was indeed a rare beauty. Everyone thought it was harmless to keep a beautiful woman\u2019s phone number.\n\nHowever, things were different now.\n\nHe swerved the steering wheel abruptly and turned around in the opposite direction. He accelerated to 200 miles an hour, and threw Lorenzo off his trail.\n\nChapter 0005\nXavier was driving dangerously fast, but his expression was exceptionally calm.\n\nIn addition to running several companies, he was also a part-time F2 racing driver.\n\nFor Lorenzo, the supercar was just a means of transportation, but in Xavier's hands, it was a toy. He was sure that Lorenzo would not be able to catch up.\n\nLorenzo watched Xavier's car zoom by his car like a ghost. He was stunned for a moment and quickly turned around. Two minutes later, he lost them.\n\nHe continued to call Xavier while flooring the accelerator, but still no one answered.\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier knew that he had other intentions when he ditched Lorenzo, but he dared not show it in front of Sydney right away.\n\nAfter all, she was still Lorenzo's wife. Xavier was one year younger than Lorenzo whom he regarded as his blood brother, so she was his sister-in-law, in a sense.\n\nHe took her to the hospital as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter the medical check-up to make sure there were no major problems, Xavier took Sydney back to Celestial Park after applying ice patches to her face.\n\nCelestial Park was a famous luxury residential area in Quill City. Sydney and Lorenzo bought their marital home here.\n\nAs soon as Sydney got to the bedroom, she saw Lorenzo sitting on the sofa at the end of the bed. There was a bottle of white wine on the round table next to him.\n\nSydney's eyes flashed. Without saying a word, she went to bed, lay down, and closed her eyes.\n\nA few seconds later, the man's footsteps were heard.\n\nSydney shivered. Her eyelashes became wet again.\n\nLorenzo suddenly got on the bed and pressed on her. She opened her eyes and started to push him away. \"Don't touch me...\"\n\nLorenzo paused, grabbed her collar with both hands, and tore her skirt apart.\n\nSydney's eyes widened with shock. Her screams echoed through the bedroom. \"Don't touch me with the hand you used to touch Chelsea Dune!\"\n\nLorenzo froze.\n\nSydney looked at him as tears poured down her face. \"I can have no dignity in front of you because we were dependent on each other for those four years. You provided a great deal for me, and you are also the closest person to me besides my mother and grandmother. My heart breaks for you because you were hurt by what happened back then. I can\u2019t bear to see you in deep pain every day because of me so I allow you to vent your grievances by hurting me!\n\n\u201cBut I can't share the same man with Chelsea, and I can't have the hand that touched her, touch me!!\n\n\u201cShe is the last straw of my dignity, Lorenzo!\"\n\nHowever, these words did not move Lorenzo to show any guilt.\n\nInstead, he became angrier. \"What about my last straw?\"\n\n\"I was disgusted by you too after Oliver touched you. What you do that night when we got registered?\"\n  \nSydney trembled. She choked.\n\nThat night.\n  \nHer mother and mother-in-law both wanted to seize the opportunity so that she and Lorenzo could have a child as soon as possible, so they tampered with their tea.\n\nLorenzo thought it was Sydney who Framed him.\n\n\"Why aren't you talking?\" Lorenzo's eyes were red as he stared into hers, \"Where did Xavier take you? He deliberately didn't answer my call. What did you do?\"\n\n\"Can you stop being suspicious of everyone and anyone? He took me to the hospital!\"\n\n\"Hospital?\" Lorenzo sneered, and he tightened his grip on her clothes, this time tearing her skirt all the way, \"Sydney, lift your legs for me!\"\n\nSydney panicked. \"What are you going to do?!\"\n\n\"Let's see if you betrayed me again!\"\n\nSydney immediately closed her knees together, \"I didn't!\"\n\nLorenzo pressed harder and his voice became more forceful, \"I don't believe a word you said!\"\n\nSuch stubborn words made Sydney lose the will to refute him.\n\nShe looked at Lorenzo\u2019s frightening and gloomy face and felt disgusted with him for the first time.\n\nShe reached out and pinched the back of his hand. \"Let me go, I'm tired, I want to sleep!\"\n\n\"I don't want to sleep, why should you sleep!\" Lorenzo was still furious. He did not seem to feel any pain in the back of his hand. The grip in his hand became stronger and stronger.\n\nHe pulled apart Sydney's knees quickly. He spread her legs apart so hard that even her behinds hurt.\n\nHe was worried that she would resist, so he pressed his knee on her belly and untied his belt.\n\nSydney's tears rolled to the side of her temples and wet the pillow. Still, she said nothing. Since pinching the back of his hand did not work, she pinched his neck hard.\n\nLorenzo winced in pain, but still did not let her go.\n\nIt felt as if he would not give up if he did not test her.\n\nLorenzo's neck,and even his arms and abdominal muscles were left bruised from Sydney's pinching while she gradually lost hope.\n\nShe wilted like dry roses, losing all trace of vitality.\n\nLorenzo endured the pain and tried to control her, but failed.\n\nSydney's tearful eyes trembled. Her hand squeezing his chest loosened, and she finally spoke again, \"Is that enough?\"\n\n\"Enough?\" Unexpectedly, Lorenzo felt even more enraged. He reached out and yanked open the drawer on the bedside table, took out the bottle of essential oil she bought, and then slammed the drawer shut!\n\nSydney seized this opportunity and tried to escape, but he grabbed her ankle in time. \"Be good!\"\n\nSydney stopped resisting. She knew she would not be able to escape tonight.\n\nShe was in tears, but she laughed. \"Lorenzo, I really didn't expect that one day I would be disgusted with you. Go ahead, disgust me more. So I can hate you enough, and give you what you want...\"\n\nShe thought, \u2018Lorenzo should know what I was referring to.\u2019\n\nIn the split second, her refusal to sign the divorce agreement suddenly wavered.\n\nDuring the time between being taken away by Xavier and being sent back home, she had been recalling the past.\n\nWhen she recalled the past with Chelsea, she did not want to lose her self-esteem. However, when she recalled every moment with Lorenzo, she did not want to regret losing the man she loved most.\n\nShe was deeply confused by these opposing feelings.\n\nHowever, right now, she actually felt disgusted with the man she loved most.\n\nShe was glad.\n\nDisgusted by him meant that she could finally let him go one day. \n\nLorenzo's face darkened at Sydney\u2019s words. He could not tell whether he was angry or something else.\n\nShe wanted to say more, but Lorenzo's lips suddenly covered hers.\n\nAt the same time, his fingertips of both hands trailed up along her waistline.\n\nThe faint smell of tobacco mixed with the fragrance and wine was an alluring masculine aroma. In the past, she could never resist his kisses.\n\nLorenzo was even wilder in the past than he is now. He was like a lion in the savanna. The passion and impulse he made her feel was strong and without restraint.\n\nApart from the four years they were separated, they had slept together for four years until now. He understood every part of her body, her preferred tension and pressure.\n\nSoon, her body reacted uncontrollably."

                      "text": "Chapter 1    \nI had thought it would be the most romantic day ever. There were two pieces of good news to celebrate today: my 3rd wedding anniversary and the fact that I'd just gotten a promotion.\nI walk eagerly to the man I love, stretching onto my toes to kiss Ryan. But he ducks, pushing something into my arms.\nWhen I unwrapped it, my whole body froze.\nA divorce document.\n\u201cThat's what I want. \u201c Ryan said coldly. His arms crossed over his chest.\u201d Honestly, I'm sick and tired of this. You're not taking care of our home. \u201d\nIt took me a minute to comprehend the current situation.\u201d It wasn't April Fool's Day. \u201d\nExasperated, Ryan rolls his angry eyes at me and gestures to the room around us. \u201c Do you know what it\u2019s like to walk into a room with cat hair everywhere and a carpet that hasn\u2019t been cleaned in months? \u201d\nMy eyes widen, my head pulling back to look at my husband. \u201cLet me remind you that I make twice as much as you do and that I am the one who pays for the cleaners. Yet, I distinctly remember conversing with you a long time ago where we agreed to take turns dividing our workload!\u201d\nThe counter-argument makes Ryan grunt, throwing his head back as he stares at the ceiling. \u201cI earn money too, Esme!\u201d He snaps at me.\n\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem here?\u201d\n\u201cThe problem? Why don\u2019t I have a housewife? You can\u2019t even be bothered to bring me a child to raise!\u201d\n\u201cMe? You do realize I want to have this baby, too, right? You\u2019re the one who refuses to go with me to the hospital! Maybe if you were a bit more active\u2014\u201d\nRyan interrupts me with a laugh that silences me.\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d He spits, seemingly implying that I\u2019m a liar. \u201cYou\u2019re having an affair with your boss; don\u2019t deny it!\u201d\nMr. Anderson? Derek Anderson? The confusion seems to proliferate, and the facial expressions that take over my face feel like a dream.\nThe only thing that is true about my boss is that he\u2019s a dashing divorced man. I\u2019m dazed at the idea my husband accuses me of sneaking behind his back.\n\u201cI can absolutely assure you, Ryan, that there never has and never will be anything regarding my boss! I am his subordinate, and there\u2019s nothing left to discuss about Mr. Anderson!\u201d\nHis arms cross over his chest again, huffing. \u201cYou\u2019re so delusional that your work has given you everything you desire when, in fact, it is your boss.\u201d\n\u201cFine. You want this divorce and to live in your fantasy world where I\u2019m the villain? I\u2019ll sign your freaking divorce papers, but not right now. For now, I\u2019m going to find a competent lawyer to help me properly divide my property from you.\u201d\nI start rushing toward the front door, needing to escape this house, this man, this absurdity.\nBut I hear Ryan chasing me down the hall. \u201cEsme! Quit stalling for more time or to conjure up new lies. If you have a clean conscience, then you should sign the papers today.\u201d\nHe grabs my arm and whirls me around, and for the first time since I met Ryan, I don\u2019t recognize the man. His eyes are dark, his skin ice cold as his fingers wrap around my upper arm, and his voice full of disgust.\nI shake my head, ripping my arm from his grasp, slap my husband in the face, and I leave the house with papers in hand and my heart bleeding on the floor in front of the man.\nHappy anniversary to me.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to murder the scum!\u201d\nMy best friends, Annie and Lily, sit at the bar on either side of me. Ransom\u2019s Tavern is our favorite place to drown our sorrows, and Lily is basically ready to go all Jeffery Dahmer on Ryan.\n\u201cAnd on your anniversary of all days! Who asks for a divorce on the day two people get married? He better be ready for me because I\u2019m going to end his entire life with one freaking punch to the face!\u201d\nI can\u2019t help but laugh at Lily as she puts up her fists like she\u2019s preparing for battle. Her nose scrunches up, and her eyebrows hide behind her brown bangs.\n\u201cCalm yourself,\u201d Annie instructs our friend.\n\u201cCalm? How can you be calm? He\u2019s just told our best friend that she\u2019s only where she is in her career because she\u2019s been sleeping with her boss! Do you know how incredibly misogynistic and disgusting that is?\u201d\n\u201cTalk louder; I don\u2019t think the entire block heard you,\u201d I reply as I take a drink. This is the last thing I need. I rub my left temple, my curly blonde hair quickly becoming tangled in my fingers.\n\u201cMoving on!\u201d Annie instructs, waving her perfectly manicured hand at Lily. Then, touching my hand on the sticky bar, Annie states seriously, \u201cEsme, if I were you, I\u2019d go to your boss\u2019 house and sleep with him. Now.\u201d\nI roll my eyes as I give the two women a sad smile. \u201cCome on, my boss isn\u2019t like you, guys. He\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s got a lot of responsibilities on his plate.\u201d\n\u201cUh, isn\u2019t your boss single now?\u201d Lily questions.\nI shrug, taking another sip of my watery beer. \u201cHe\u2019s got two daughters, and from what I\u2019ve heard, he takes care of them independently.\u201d\n\u201cAka, he\u2019s single and maybe ready to mingle?\u201d Annie teases, biting her bottom lip at her joke.\nI nudge my shoulder against hers, unable to keep a laugh from rising out of me. \u201cStop it!\u201d\nI wouldn\u2019t be shocked if Anderson is single, especially since he never works overtime. He always leaves as soon as the clock strikes five like Cinderella leaving the ball at midnight.\nBut as I sit here, I start to wonder if the booze has already saturated my mind. Because suddenly, Anderson is all I\u2019m able to think about.\nWho would it hurt if I were to maybe\u2026text him? Ryan would be furious, absolutely floored at my gall. But my anger, my desire to hurt the man who I\u2019d married three years ago, fuels my rage.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to text him,\u201d I tell the girls, pulling out my phone. I\u2019m going to tell him exactly where I am right now and use this to relieve some of the anger.\nGetting back at Ryan for his selfish and pathetic behavior? Better than giving him a swift kick in his special little place.\n\u201cNo way. Prove it!\u201d Annie smirks, looking down at my phone lying on the bar.\nI pick up the phone, typing in Anderson\u2019s name in my messages. I\u2019ll send him my address as if supposedly informing a friend of my whereabouts. Then, after about a minute, I\u2019ll just tell him I\u2019d sent the message to the wrong person.\nNo harm, no foul.\nBesides, it\u2019s already 8:45. It must be parenting time for Anderson.\nI type in the address to Ransom\u2019s Tavern and hit send. I put down the phone, my friends laughing and shoving me with disbelief.\nTo my surprise, my phone buzzes back immediately with a reply.\n\u201cFive minutes.\u201d\n\nChapter 2\n\u201cNo way, no way!\u201d Annie squeals as she grabs my phone from my hands. Her pale blue eyes sparkle with mischief. \u201cLily, he\u2019s coming!\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Lily shouts, reaching across me to take my phone next, pushing a piece of her short brown hair away from her face.\n\u201cThis is absolutely crazy. I can\u2019t even believe it! Five minutes? That\u2019s so fast!\u201d Annie cries, her arm catapulting back for the phone.\n\u201cOh my God, I\u2019m so excited, I can\u2019t wait to see what he looks like!\u201d Lily adds, jumping in her bar seat with excitement.\nThe two of them are growing louder by the second, and now I\u2019m starting to get a headache and regret my message.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you just point out that he\u2019s got two daughters? It\u2019s a school night. He\u2019s probably spending time with the kids,\u201d Lily points out as Annie re-reads the texts for the tenth time.\n\u201cWhat do you think this means?\u201d Annie asks, still staring at my phone.\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll bring them along,\u201d Lily gushes.\nI\u2019m too stunned to say anything. Did I really do this to myself? I can\u2019t even believe it!\nAs if a magic wand is waved over my head, I feel the drunkenness clears up instantly, and now I\u2019m sweating from every possible place I can think of.\n\u201cHe\u2026he must have thought I was contacting him for a work-related matter,\u201d I find myself stammering to the girls. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly dedicated.\u201d\nAnnie shakes her head. \u201cExcept this is outside of work hours, honey. Besides, he knows this is a pub, yet here he is, rushing over like your knight in shining armor!\u201d\nShe and Lily scream again, their bodies jumping up and down in the bar seats as they shake their arms in the air.\nWell, if the drunkenness has left, then bring on the hangover because I am far too sober for this.\nI\u2019m honestly speechless now. My friends must be overthinking things, surely. I mean, Anderson is just so professional in the office. He cares for his subordinates, and I know that.\nBesides, I\u2019ve never messaged him outside of the working hours in the past, so that must have made him inclined to believe it must be something serious.\nEven if that\u2019s not the case, I can\u2019t help but continue panicking in my head over the fact Anderson will be here soon.\nAs the end of the five minutes approaches, Lily and Annie decide to step aside to let me handle this situation on my own. They sit at a table in the back of the bar, watching me like I\u2019m their newest form of entertainment.\nI better come up with a perfect lie. I\u2019m starting to sweat and growing more nervous by the second for Anderson to show up. Maybe something about how work has been a struggle, or I\u2019ve had a few difficult clients?\nAs the thoughts run through my head, they\u2019re quickly sent away when Anderson walks into the bar in an elegant, perfectly tailored suit. His eyes search for me before landing on the bar, and he smiles gently.\nStanding at what I can imagine to be over six feet tall, Derek Anderson is a white yet tanned man in his late thirties with dark brown hair on his head. He has his usual dark smudges under his eyes, which match his exhaustion. He\u2019s also just about one of the most good-looking men I\u2019ve ever seen.\nI quickly scramble to my feet once he enters, realizing I have absolutely no idea what I must look like. A wreck, probably, considering I just got dumped by my own husband. Is my hair okay? What about my makeup?\nOh man, what about my breath?\nAnderson approaches, keeping his smile spread out on his face. I take a deep breath, and tell myself to calm down.\n\u201cCongratulations on your promotion, Esme,\u201d Anderson says once he\u2019s closed the distance. He looks really good tonight.\n\u201cT-Thank you,\u201d I stutter out, trying to keep my composure. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to taking on the new responsibilities.\u201d\nWe both sit at the bar together, still keeping one another in our line of sight.\nI do put a lot of time into my job, and it is genuinely rewarding and fulfilling. I mean, the years I\u2019ve put into it have given me such a rush of pride. But thinking of Ryan\u2019s complaints scratches at the surface of my skin.\n\u201cI brought you a gift to celebrate,\u201d Anderson states, holding out a small bag for me to take from him.\nSurprised, I reached out for the bag. What could he have possibly grabbed for me in the five minutes it took for him to arrive?\n\u201cThank you, Mr. Anderson, that\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d\nHe gestures to the bag. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you open it?\u201d\nI look down at the bag, feeling awkward about opening his gift right here, but do as he asks.\nI can\u2019t contain my absolute shock when I pull the gift out of the bag. A jewelry box?\nI slowly open the box, seeing a beautiful necklace inside. My jaw drops.\n\u201cW-w-what? How did you\u2014?\u201d\nAnderson gives me a sheepish smile, nodding at the box. \u201cI happened to notice your phone\u2019s wallpaper recently, and\u2026\u201d He rubs the back of his neck. \u201cI hope that it wasn\u2019t too personal.\u201d\nI can\u2019t hide my stunned expression. This is so thoughtful of Anderson, and I raise my eyes to his. How do I even thank him for this?\nThe necklace, a beautiful silver chain with a dark blue heart wrapped around it, was supposed to be a gift hint for Ryan to find. I picked it out because I knew how perfect it would match my own dark blue eyes.\nI\u2019ve been eyeing this for weeks and was so, so hopeful he would figure out my desire to own it.\nI\u2019m so confused because this is like my dream wedding anniversary! Though, in reality, it\u2019s all a mess\u2014yet here I stand with my own boss, my eyes wide and mouth agape as I hold onto the beautiful jewelry.\nThis is Anderson handing over this gift, though. Not my own husband.\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting a divorce!\u201d I blurt out without a thought.\nMy boss\u2019s expression morphs, and he gives off a strange expression. \u201cSorry?\u201d He questions.\nAt this very moment, I notice something pink on the corner of Anderson\u2019s suit. Is that\u2026Peppa Pig? A sticker?\nGod, what the heck am I doing? This is my boss! He\u2019s a mature man with children and professional conduct. A full-fledged, single father with no need for some random employee to take up his incredibly important time.\nI take one deep breath, then another. Calm down a second. This day has been such a whirlwind that I must have gotten swept up in the kind gesture from Anderson.\nMy nerves are growing, and I feel inexplicably and desperately wanting to escape this incredibly awkward situation. My personal life doesn\u2019t need to be brought up in front of Anderson, so what am I doing talking to him like we\u2019re old friends catching up?\nOut of professionalism, it\u2019s imperative that my personal matters are handled privately and have nothing to do with him. What am I even doing calling him to the bar and divulging that I\u2019m leaving Ryan behind?\nAbruptly, I make my voice sound natural, though it doesn\u2019t feel as such. \u201cWhat I meant to say was,\u201d I start, another breath to calm myself. \u201cI\u2019d like to request time off.\u201d\nAnderson raises his left eyebrow.\nI nearly cough. \u201cI need to handle the\u2026related paperwork, if that\u2019s okay, sir?\u201d\nIt feels like a bowling ball has landed on my chest as I watch his expression go unchanging. God, of all the times, to sound like a complete bumbling mess, it has to be in front of my boss.\n\nChapter 3\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d Anderson asks after the silence becomes too stuffy. He\u2019s frowning slightly, and I notice his posture slightly worsen.\nIn my head, I\u2019m thinking, What else? After all, when he arrived, he had no clue about my fight with Ryan. Does he even know today was our anniversary?\nFor some reason, as I continue to stare at the man, I feel a sense of something. Is it\u2026disappointment? Why?\nInstead of probing him with more questions, I nod my head up at the tall man. His eyes, dark and honestly somewhat mysterious, crash against my skin like a hot laser burning into me.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all, yes,\u201d I finally reply.\nI look at Anderson, and then my eyes drift over to Annie and Lily in the corner of the bar. They\u2019re watching so intensely you\u2019d think they've never seen two people interact before. I feel severe discomfort with their daggers.\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Anderson says, straightening his suit jacket. \u201cYour time off is approved. If there is anything else I can do for you, please let me know.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I say to him, wanting to give a smile but struggling to let myself give one away. He\u2019s a kind man, and I appreciate his understanding.\n\u201cOf course. Though, I have one more question, Esme.\u201d\nI turn my head to the side at the statement.\n\u201cAre you here alone tonight?\u201d Anderson\u2019s voice seems to warble a bit, and it throws me off for a moment. Did it matter if I\u2019m here by myself or not?\nNot wanting to lie but still feeling a bit nervous, I nod my head again. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d\nAnderson stands back up to depart, wiping something off of his jacket. As he does this, a waiter comes up to me and deposits a drink in front of me.\n\u201cOh, no, I didn\u2019t order\u2014\u201d I start to say, unsure where this mystery drink came from.\n\u201cCharge it double and put it on my tab,\u201d Anderson deadpans, handing over his card to the waiter, who quickly swipes it through and gives it back.\n\u201cSir, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d\nBefore I can speak, Anderson returns the card to his pocket. \u201cGoodnight, Esme. I hope your paperwork is sorted out shortly.\u201d\n\u201cBut sir, you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d I\u2019m sputtering, but he holds up his hand to stop my sentence again.\n\u201cEnjoy your night.\u201d\nAnderson then walks out of the bar alone, and I can\u2019t help but stare in disbelief at the man as he disappears behind the walls. What the heck just happened?\nThat was all so weird, and I\u2019m struggling to find any words to say now that I\u2019ve been left alone at the bar.\nIt takes another few seconds, but Annie and Lily come rushing over with bright eyes. I can tell the two are ready to start interrogating me for what happened between us, but in truth, I don\u2019t have any words for them.\nInstead, all I can do is gesture with my hands at what is before me. The necklace, the drink, and my confusion are all present.\nI want to tell them I don\u2019t know what happened, but I think my face is saying that enough. Because I don\u2019t know anything. This was all just\u2026random?\nLily, snickering to herself, mimics Anderson under her breath with her large smile. \u201cI\u2019ll pay double.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d Annie pushes, and I just shrug.\n\u201cOh, come on! He walks in here and hands you some fancy jewelry and then hands over his card without even knowing what you\u2019re drinking. That was him clearly flirting!\u201d Lily says dreamily.\n\u201cHardly,\u201d my voice croaks.\n\u201cHow many men would come into this bar and do the exact same thing, though, Esme?\u201d Annie insists. \u201cThat man just swept you off your feet!\u201d\nI look at the door where Anderson exited, wanting to ask him what is going through his head. But that\u2019s the issue. Now he\u2019s left again, and I\u2019m left wondering what this day has turned into.\nA freaking fiasco, for sure.\nLater, after finally getting Lily and Annie to let me leave the bar and return home, I climb into my empty bed.\nAlone for the first time in years, I feel helpless over my foreseeable future. It\u2019s hard to judge whether things will be good or not with Ryan already pushing and shoving his way out the door.\nWhat am I supposed to do about all of this? Today should have been perfect. Ryan could have swept me off my feet, and we could have had a romantic dinner together, shared gifts and kisses and laughter, and enjoyed ourselves. Instead, here I am, holding back tears against my pillow.\nI got a promotion, and on my wedding anniversary at the age of 30, I\u2019m about to lose my marriage. What\u2019s worse is I\u2019m still childless, which causes my heart to strain. I don\u2019t want that label. I don\u2019t want that nightmare.\nNow, I\u2019m going to be the divorced single woman everywhere I try to go.\nOr, maybe, a single, divorced career woman.\nThough, that seems to be even more stressful than the divorced woman label.\nI shake my head out on the pillow, throwing my face into the sheet. This is all happening so bloody fast that I\u2019m unsure what else to do.\nAnd on top of everything bad that\u2019s happened today, I can\u2019t stop replaying Anderson\u2019s facial expressions and kindness toward me. He\u2019s a genuinely kind individual, so having him attempt to comfort me was sympathetic.\nI can\u2019t imagine Ryan doing the same for me, even if we are still married. His compassionate side has never been his strong suit.\nThen again, maybe I\u2019ve just been wearing rose-tinted glasses the whole time, and he was never a good husband to begin with. I guess it\u2019s possible to be lost in a world of love.\nGrunting and rolling over to get out of bed, I realize that sleep shall continue to evade unless I do something about it.\nGrabbing my wallet and a light jacket to cover my pajamas, I finally exit my place, trudging downstairs and out into the world to fix this incredibly horrid headache and insomnia.\nAround the corner from my place is a 24-hour convenience store. Maybe the clinic will have the meds I\u2019m looking for. Regardless, I\u2019m so over this day, and I just want to sleep and have it be tomorrow.\nThe best way forward is through, after all.\nI shuffle into the clinic, making my way to the medication section. I tend to pick up whatever the strongest medications happen to be on the shelf.\nAt this rate, they\u2019re going to need to make a simple medication to calm my anxiety, too.\nMaybe I should go back to the doctor. My insomnia hasn\u2019t really corrupted my sleep and made me this tired in years. But clearly, I\u2019ll be struggling for the foreseeable future.\nI shuffle into the next aisle to grab a large bottle of water to take with my meds. As I get to the front of the store to pay for my supplies, I hear a voice I recognize.\n\u201cIs this the right one, you think?\u201d He asks another person nearby.\nI stretch my neck, seeing the one person I\u2019m desperately trying not to think about.\nI see the short haired blonde first, and I\u2019m surprised to see Ryan standing in the aisle just to the left of me. Then, I hear a second voice.\n\u201cMaybe we get this one,\u201d she replies.\nI narrow my eyes, and as I thank the man at the counter, I walk over to the two people.\nIt\u2019s Ryan alright, but the person he\u2019s with?\nMy cousin, Melinda. With her picture-perfect beauty and her short black hair pulled into a pathetic excuse for a ponytail, I look at the two of them down the aisle.\nAnd the object they\u2019re talking about is a freaking test stick?\n\nChapter 4\n\u201cYou really had to do this to me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Melinda complains as they pick up another stick to examine. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have used protection before you got the divorce?\u201d\n\u201cBabe, it\u2019s going to be fine because we\u2019re going to be divorced soon! Esme\u2014that freaking foolish woman\u2014she\u2019s got no idea about us! Besides, she\u2019s got significantly more savings than I do, and soon, we\u2019re going to inherit a fortune!\u201d\n\u201cYou better hope so, dummy,\u201d Melinda grunts as she turns the pink box over in her hands. \u201cThis is stressing me out.\u201d\n\u201cLook, we\u2019ll inherit the money, we\u2019ll be rich, and you and I will be together. You should get knocked up immediately, unlike Esme. She can\u2019t even have kids!\u201d\nI feel my heart turn cold, my skin burns, and my anger blinds me. This cheater! This whole time, I thought our main issue was over not having children!\nMy fingers strain around the bottles I hold, and a million different things cross my mind to screech at these two people; people I trusted!\nThis entire marriage has never hindered kids; it\u2019s only ever been for Ryan to divorce me and take my money! That spineless, pathetic scum.\n\u201cMelinda! What the heck?\u201d I screech at the two, giving away my position. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you got into bed with him!\u201d\nThe two of them turn to look at me, eyebrows raised, and, at least in my cousin\u2019s face, a slight hint of fear.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Ryan demands.\n\u201cHearing you plan your new life.\u201d I glower at my soon-to-be ex-husband. \u201cYou really think I\u2019m this foolish?\u201d\n\u201cOh no, I don\u2019t think it, I know it!\u201d Ryan retorts back.\nI look straight at my cousin, my eyes falling into slits as I speak the truth. \u201cI don\u2019t have children. No. But maybe that\u2019s because this man\u2019s got useless seeds.\u201d\nI jab a finger in Ryan\u2019s direction. \u201cI won\u2019t let you parasites take a single penny from me! This is freaking war.\u201d\nI stomp out of the pharmacy with a new purpose and officially wide awake. I\u2019m not letting this ship go down. Just the opposite: I\u2019m going to ruin their lives.\nI\u2019m getting a lawyer, gathering all the evidence, and I\u2019m taking them down every peg possible.\nBut first, I need to move out of this place. The thought of Ryan and Melinda doing it in my bed makes me want to vomit.\nI spend the night putting together what I can find, refusing to let sleep take me away from my work.\nOnce the sun comes up, I start chugging coffee, heading into the office to ask if any of my colleagues know anything about nearby rental options.\nI let myself get lost in my job and rental searches, frantic as I let the day whiz by me. It\u2019s not until I stop for a moment in the daze of anger and work that I realize two things:\nThe first one is that I told Anderson I needed time off, and I still came into the office today.\nThe second one is that it\u2019s almost five, and I have two messages from my boss asking me to come to his office when I have a moment.\n\u201cHeck!\u201d I whisper. I stand up abruptly, grab my phone, and throw it into my pocket, rushing down the hall to Anderson\u2019s office. God, this is going to look really weird, isn\u2019t it?\nI knock on the door and straighten myself out, but in my head, I know I\u2019m going to look like a mess.\n\u201cCome in,\u201d I hear Anderson call, and I slowly open the door.\n\u201cHi,\u201d I say shyly, moving forward into the room.\n\u201cAh, Esme,\u201d he smiles. He gestures at me. \u201cCome in, close the door behind you.\u201d\nOh God, am I being fired?\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, I didn\u2019t see your messages until just now. I was busy with my work.\u201d\nHe nods but tells me to sit down. \u201cNo problem, I just wanted to discuss something with you.\u201d\nThe moment my body touches the soft cushion of the chair, I\u2019m quick to explain. \u201cI completely forgot that I\u2019d asked for time off, and then I didn\u2019t even remember until I read your messages! I\u2019m so sorry for\u2014\u201d\nHe holds up a hand to stop me, and I listen, confused. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I called you in here.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d I say, shrinking into the chair. If I could just disappear into thin air right now, that\u2019d be wonderful.\n\u201cI did, however, want to ask you if you\u2019re alright. You do seem a bit\u2026tense.\u201d\nI need the power of invisibility right about now.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I lie.\n\u201cAnd the conversations around the office about you looking for rental options?\u201d\nHeck, I\u2019ve been caught.\n\u201cAre you looking for a place, Esme?\u201d He asks again.\nHe must have listened in on one of those conversations because I only spoke to a few people, and they were relatively short ones.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, really, I hope you can understand that this has been a difficult time for me. I\u2019m sorry for discussing personal matters during work hours.\u201d\nHe raises his hands to me to calm me.\n\u201cEsme, take a breath. It\u2019s fine; we have a comprehensive employee care system.\u201d Anderson gives me a deep look, seemingly looking for something. \u201cConsidering your\u2026special situation, the company has some housing allowances for employees.\u201d\nI sit up straighter. \u201cReally?\u201d\nThe man nods. \u201cYes.\u201d\nI let a long sigh out. \u201cOh, wow, okay, thank you, sir. And thank you for not telling anyone about the divorce. I haven\u2019t told anyone, and I\u2019m not exactly ready for the entire thing to go public.\u201d\nHe nods again. \u201cThat\u2019s tough, and I understand.\u201d\nI feel compelled to apologize again; this information on the housing is incredibly helpful, and I\u2019m so sleep-deprived that it actually seems like a good idea to shake his hand and give him a hug.\nGet your things together, Esme.\nHis small smile and that nod, however, make me feel a special spark ripple through me. Finally, someone understands and has given me the best encouragement I\u2019ve received yet.\nI\u2019m so grateful for his kindness, but a few tears prickle the corners of my eyes. Something about his stature and genuine concern for my well-being and home life makes me feel closer to Anderson than to my own friends.\n\u201cI appreciate the information and for everything you\u2019ve done for me, sir.\u201d\n\u201cMy best employee deserves to know that she is a valuable member to the team. If you\u2019re not in top fighting shape, then we all lose, correct?\u201d\nI nod vigorously. \u201cOf course, yes.\u201d\n\u201cVery well. Go speak to Mrs. Halloway on the third floor about your housing request, and she should be able to get everything sorted out for you today. Hurry, though, she\u2019ll be leaving any minute.\u201d\nI jump up, and without really thinking, I get moving, calling over my shoulder my appreciation once more.\nAs I rush down the stairs, I remind myself that Anderson is also divorced. He\u2019s even got two little girls to take care of. Maybe, this is a shared sympathy?\nHe must know the torture I\u2019ve been enduring since Ryan\u2019s heinous words last night. A divorce is a painful process.\nI believe, however, that my situation is guaranteed worse than anyone will know.\nI manage to catch Mrs. Halloway as she\u2019s putting her papers together to leave. She is kind enough to sit with me for twenty minutes after five as we sign papers, and I\u2019m given the keys to a new apartment to live in.\nI call Annie and Lily in hopes the two women can help me move out tonight. The sooner I\u2019m out of this place, the better.\nAs we\u2019re putting my things into boxes as quickly as possible, the girls prod me with a bunch of questions.\nClearly, everything is moving quickly to them.\n\u201cYou said this is company-provided housing?\u201d Annie asks, incredulous.\n\nChapter 5\nI smile, pushing some curly blonde hair behind my ear and out of my eyes. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d\n\u201cHow much is your rent going to cost?\u201d Lily jumps in.\nI think for a second, putting books into another box. \u201cUh, about two thousand.\u201d\nLily throws a pillow at me, pursing her red lips in my direction as she waves her arms around in the air. \u201cI\u2019m going to murder you!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I laugh, unsure what she\u2019s talking about.\n\u201cI never envied your promotion; everyone knows how hard you work. If I worked late like you, my face would collapse!\u201d\nAnnie says, \u201cBut this, I cannot forgive you for!\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I question, hands on my waist.\nThe two girls look at one another before returning their gazes to me.\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Annie replies, rolling her eyes.\n\u201cCity center,\u201d Lily ticks on her finger.\n\u201cOne thousand square meters,\u201d Annie says next.\n\u201cFully furnished apartment.\u201d\n\u201cSwimming pool, security, a gym downstairs.\u201d\n\u201cOnly 100 meters from the closest shopping center!\u201d\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to kick you out after you\u2019ve signed the contract.\u201d Lily crosses her arms with a satisfying smirk on her face.\nI roll my eyes and sigh but understand they\u2019re having fun at my expense. \u201cGirls, this is the employee care system, okay? I\u2019m getting a divorce.\u201d\nI point at Lily. \u201cAnd you? With one handsome boyfriend after another.\u201d Then, I point at the tall blonde. \u201cAnd you, with a husband that absolutely adores you! Life is fair for the two of you, and there\u2019s no need to be jealous of my pathetic life.\u201d\nI let myself fall to the ground with my legs crossed, exhausted.\nAnnie approaches me, her hand on my shoulder. \u201cWe know, hon,\u201d she reassures me.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re sorry you\u2019re going through all of this right now,\u201d Lily adds, joining us on the floor.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to keep you as happy as we can,\u201d the first woman insists. \u201cYou\u2019re our best friend, Esme, and we just want you to smile.\u201d\nI take both girls around the shoulders and hold them close, so thankful to have the two greatest friends on the planet.\n\u201cWhat the heck would I do without you two?\u201d\nLily shrugs against my embrace. \u201cYou\u2019d probably be packing this place by yourself?\u201d\nAnnie nods matter-of-factly. \u201cAlso, no one would be here to taunt you.\u201d\n\u201cOr remind you that Ryan\u2019s a loser, and you\u2019re a thousand times better off without him!\u201d\n\u201cPlus, then you\u2019d have no one to invite to your new, beautiful, stunning apartment!\u201d Annie finishes, clapping her hands together as I let them both go.\n\u201cYou two are absolutely ridiculous!\u201d I roll my eyes.\n\u201cBut you love us!\u201d They sing song together.\nIt takes only a few hours of rushed packing to get out of the house I\u2019ve lived in for the past several years. I look around one more time once the girls have left, saying goodbye to pieces of my home that will no longer be mine.\nThe perfect window perch to look out at the view around me.\nThe spot on the wooded living room floor where I\u2019d spilled just a touch of black nail polish.\nThe perfect shower and bath combo that I used to lie in for hours at a time enjoying the calm.\nThe walk-in closet is mostly barren now.\nThe steps that I\u2019d tripped down the first time I got a promotion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to say goodbye,\u201d I whisper to the house. The creaks and the shadows that I\u2019ve grown so used to will just become a faded memory. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d\nA creak in the ceiling sounds as if the home is replying to my final words.\n\u201cThank you for these past few years,\u201d I finish, standing in the middle of the living room and taking one final deep breath in.\nThen, I take off my wedding ring and place it on the kitchen table next to my house key. This is it. This is the end of my story here.\nI grab my car keys off the counter by the front door, take one more look around, and then I finally make my exit, knowing there\u2019s no chance I\u2019ll ever walk through this door again.\nI\u2019m no longer Esme, Ryan\u2019s wife.\nNow I\u2019m Esme, a strong, independent woman who is relearning the world around her.\n\u201cYou took your sweet time,\u201d Lily taunts as I finally get into my car downstairs.\n\u201cJust needed to say goodbye,\u201d I insist.\n\u201cOnly you would say goodbye to a freaking house,\u201d Annie says, poking my arm from the passenger seat. Her nails are white today, and I swat her hand away.\n\u201cLet\u2019s gooo, come on!\u201d Lily cries, holding out the second word to annoy us. She jumps up and down in the backseat. \u201cOnward to new adventures, Esme!\u201d\nThe drive to the new apartment isn\u2019t too far. It\u2019s about ten minutes away from the house, and surprisingly, it\u2019s pretty close to our favorite dive, Ransom\u2019s Tavern. That\u2019s pretty perfect since it\u2019s the middle point for all three of us.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Annie whispers as she looks out the window on her side of the car. \u201cLook how beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you said the city center, you really meant it,\u201d I reply to the two, leaning forward in my car to see the apartment building as it towers over us.\n\u201cThe name fits well, too,\u201d Lily adds, pointing out the window ahead of us. I follow her gaze as I see the plaque.\n\u201cCenter City Apartments.\u201d\n\u201cThis is nuts,\u201d I say without really thinking about it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling us,\u201d Lily huffs. \u201cHeck, Esme.\u201d\nWe get a parking spot to the elevators closest to where my unit is supposed to be, and the girls and I start planning our attack.\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s get the important stuff into the bedroom first, and then we\u2019ll grab everything else and put it in the living room,\u201d I instruct.\n\u201cGood plan,\u201d Annie nods, pulling her straight, blonde hair into a ponytail.\nWe spend about an hour just bringing things up to the apartment, moving quickly and laughing with one another about how dumb we all look doing this.\n\u201cHire movers next time!\u201d Lily grunts as she drops a box of clothes on the ground. \u201cIf I\u2019d known this was how I was spending tonight, I\u2019d have told you I was busy!\u201d\nAnnie bumps our friend as she walks by with another box of pictures and memorabilia. \u201cAt least if she hired movers, they\u2019d probably be hot!\u201d\nLily gasps. \u201cOh God, yes! They\u2019d probably be all hot and sweaty and look amazing. Instead, I stink, and I\u2019m tired and hungry!\u201d\nI throw the closest object at Lily, which just so happens to be my car keys. \u201cYou love me, and you\u2019d never leave me in the lurch.\u201d\nAnnie and Lily both shrug at the same time, and the three of us head back to the car for the final round of transferring my stuff.\nOnce we\u2019re done, the two girls decide to utilize the fully furnished couches, but I end up kicking them out so they can each go home and spend time with their men.\n\u201cCall us later if you need some talk therapy?\u201d Annie asks.\nI give her a hug. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me, I\u2019ll be sleeping for the next four days,\u201d Lily deadpans, so I shove her playfully before giving her a hug and watching the two head off together.\nI look around the apartment, not sure where to start. Maybe the best step is to be neighborly and go greet the people who live next store.\nI head out of the door and go to put my new key in my side pocket. However, I accidentally drop the metal onto the ground and crouch down to pick it up.\nSuddenly, as I\u2019m picking up the key, a little missile comes barreling toward me, and the blur crashes into my arms before falling to the ground.\nInstincts take over, and I quickly pick up the small child, an adorable little girl with dark hair. Instantly, she begins to cry as I hold her close and stand back up.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay!\u201d I tell her, bouncing her. \u201cDon\u2019t cry!\u201d\nI look around for an adult, but I\u2019m only met with another girl, a few years older than the first, who looks like a carbon copy. However, she is glaring at me.\n\u201cHow dare you make my sister cry!\u201d She shouts out. \u201cI\u2019m telling my dad on you!\u201d\nThen, as the older girl is yelling, a man in a bathrobe comes running out of the apartment next door, calling out his apologies for his daughter scaring me.\nThe first thing I see is a set of perfect abs, and I have a hard time pulling away from the sight. Wow, what a handsome set of abs.\nMy eyes move up from the abs to the eyes of the tall, tanned man. He looks incredibly relaxed and handsome as he stands in front of me, but it takes me about five seconds longer than it should to put it together.\nI can\u2019t help but gulp as I set down the girl in my arms.\nMy boss\u2026he\u2019s my neighbor?!"

                      "text": "Chapter 0001\nIt was ten o'clock in the evening. Sydney Castro sat in front of the dressing table, rubbing essential oils on her body for that glowing skin.\n\nClearly, she was getting ready to please a man.\n\nHer husband, whom she had not seen for two years, was returning to Somerland today. She missed him terribly.\n\nSydney oiled every part of her body until she was soft and smooth. Then she put on a white, furry lingerie set with a cheeky little cat tail on the small of her back.\n\nIn truth, she did not have to go to such trouble in the past. Lorenzo had wished he could stick to her every day, but after that fateful day, everything changed.\n\nShe went from being his closest lover to the woman he hated the most.\n\nLater, their elders arranged for them to get married. However, Lorenzo was so reluctant that he left the country the day after signing their marriage certificate.\n\nNow two years have passed, during which he only contacted her once. It was six months after her mother's death that he sent her a divorce agreement.\n\nSydney did not sign the papers. She still harbored thoughts of rekindling her marriage with Lorenzo.\n\nHowever, it was difficult.\n\nShe was not even aware he was returning tonight. She only found out when she saw Lorenzo\u2019s friends posted about their drinking session on social media.\n\nLater, she called her mother-in-law, who helped her and sent a driver to bring Lorenzo back.\n\nThe driver called. Lorenzo would be home in a few minutes.\n\nShe had to seize this opportunity and try to rekindle their old flame again.\n\nIntentionally dressed up, she knelt on fours by the bed, evenly distributing the rose petals that had been sprinkled on the bed in advance. She was so engrossed that she did not notice a long shadow walking in.\n\nSuddenly, Sydney\u2019s cat tail was yanked hard as a hot-blooded torso pressed on her back. Her heart skipped a beat. She turned back and came face-to-face with a deep yet intense set of piercing eyes.\n\n\"Enzo...\" she began delicately, \"You finally came...\" Back.\n\nThe rest of her sentence was choked back by a kiss reeking of ethanol.\n\nSydney's eyelashes fluttered as her body responded to his. She was not sure whether Lorenzo was drunk or if her outfit tonight was a success. \n\nLorenzo kissed her so passionately that he wanted to suck her lips swollen. He placed his hands over her waist , grabbing them vigorously.\n\nThe man seemed satisfied. While taking a breath, he growled in a whisper. \"good...\"\n\nGrowling in a whisper was considered flirting. That was Lorenzo\u2019s special habit. \n\nRecently, she had been doing yoga. Her figure was way better than two years ago. This was also a surprise for Lorenzo. His words and actions ignited the fire in her heart.\n\nHer plump waist rose and fell violently. Her rapid breath escaped her rosy lips. Her glowy, fair hands explored his waist through his custom silk shirt, caressing his hard and steamy muscles for the first time in a long time. She hurriedly unbuttoned his shirt.\n\nThe smooth material slid down his strong arms. She unbuckled his belt and wrapped her legs around his waist.\n\nEight years of familiarity with each other made them very compatible in bed. No need for any fluff, they went straight into it.\n\nPerhaps it was because they had not seen each other for too long. His desire seemed to be even more intense than hers, just like when he first tasted the forbidden fruit eight years ago. The man was excited and tireless.\n\nThis went on for more than three hours. Finally, he was satisfied.\n\nSydney laid on the man's beautiful sculpted chest and kissed his handsome face obsessively, trying to make up for lost time.\n\nLorenzo kept his eyes closed, allowing her kisses.\n\n \"I'm very pleased with you tonight.\"Lorenzo said\n\nSydney smiled and kissed the corner of his lips again.\n\nLorenzo raised the corners of his lips. He grabbed her waist hard, and turned over to hold her down.\n\nSydney was sure that he was in a good mood now.\n\nShe stretched out her hand to rub his Adam's apple. Right before they did it again, she said bluntly, \"Enzo, four years ago\u2026I swear nothing happened between Oliver and I. My body and soul completely belong to you. You are finally back. Can we please forget what happened that day and move forward together?\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the smile on the man's face froze instantly.\n\nLorenzo raised his hand and grabbed Sydney\u2019s throat. \n\nSydney's heart skipped a beat. She widened her eyes in panic. It was over. She had said the wrong thing.\n\nThis happened twice before. If she mentioned the words \"four years ago\", Lorenzo would immediately become ruthless and sinister.\n\nHer best friend once said that Lorenzo's reaction was akin to PTSD, a post-traumatic stress reaction.\n\nShe had doubts at the time, and it turned out to be the same today, which proved that her best friend was right.\n\nIn a daze, she heard Lorenzo say, \"Move forward with me? You?\n\n\"I touched you tonight because I'm afraid that you,  wouldn\u2019t change your disgusting habit and sleep with my friends again!\"\n\n\"I won't, I didn\u2019t...\" Sydney explained and reached out to touch his hand, attempting to soothe him.\n\nLorenzo's hand tightened, \"Don't touch me!\"\n\nSydney's face was red from Lorenzo\u2019s grip on her throat.\n\nLorenzo took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. \"You'd better sign the divorce agreement as soon as possible. The past love we had will never be rekindled.\"\n\n The words \u2018divorce agreement\u2019 stabbed Sydney\u2019s heart like a sword. She looked up anxiously, and said with difficulty, \"We were so good back then. Are you going to completely deny all that I\u2019ve done for you, just because of that incident?\n\n\"Oliver and I both explained back then that nothing happened to us. We were set up!\"\n\nHowever, the more she explained, the angrier Lorenzo became. His hand went up her neck and grabbed her chin. The force in his grip became stronger and stronger. Sydney could feel that he wanted to crush her chin.\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\nHe ignored her cries of pain.\n\n\"Set up? Lying on the same bed with him might be a set up, but what about the child in your belly?\"\n\n\"Sydney, I wanted so badly for that baby to be mine at that time... But all the hospitals we went to in Quill City showed the same result: You were fifteen days conceived a baby.!\n\n\"I was on a business trip for two months and you were fifteen days conceived a baby. How could you make me believe that nothing happened between you and him?!\"\n\nAfter that, Lorenzo shook her off.\n\nSydney fell on the pillow. She straightened her messy hair, stood up again and explained shakily, \"But the first doctor I consulted was a traditional medicine practitioner. The old doctor said that I was two months conceived a baby. I didn't tell you immediately because I wanted to wait for you to come back to give you a surprise!\n\n\"You\u2019ve met that old doctor too. He showed you the prescription he gave me with the time written on it. Why won't you...\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Lorenzo interrupted her, \"Handwritten time has no credibility, and it's easier to bribe an old traditional medicine practitioner. Stop now and shut up!\"\n\nShe stood in his shoes and could understand the hurt in his heart. However, she still felt heartbroken from how he decisively shunned her.\n\nEspecially their child. The rejection was heartbreakingly painful.\n\nShe knew it was useless to say anything, so she kept quiet and shed tears of frustration.\n\nLorenzo got out of bed and made a phone call.\n\nThe room was quiet. As the call connected, Sydney heard the voice on the other end. She quickly got out of bed.\n\nA woman\u2019s voice. \"Mr. Bailey\u2026\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"Are you still here?\"\n\nWoman, \"Yes, do you want to come over?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lorenzo said and hung up the phone. \n\nSydney held him back. Her eyes widened with tears and her voice trembled. \"Are you seeing someone else?\"\n\nChapter 0002\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\nSydney\u2019s world collapsed as she burst into tears. \"When did it happen?! Who is she?!\"\n\nShe looked utterly miserable now. Lorenzo had no mercy, he might have even felt a little pleasure seeing her in pain.\n\n\"Can\u2019t stand seeing me with someone else?\"\n\nYes, she could not stand it.\n\nLoving a person would inherently make one possessive. Lorenzo meant so much to her that she could not accept losing him.\n\nAt this moment, the way she was just speechlessly hyperventilating due to the blow was more pathetic than crying. It felt like she was falling to pieces.\n\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He got dressed and left the bedroom.\n\nSydney refused to give up and chased after him. \"Why won\u2019t you believe that I was set up?\"\n\nLorenzo stopped and turned around. \"Then tell me, who set you up?\"\n\nThe corridor of the mansion was wide and long. Sydney was speechless as she looked at the lanky man in white shirt and trousers.    \n\nFour years ago, they talked about this many times. Each time they got stuck here.\n\nExactly.\n\nShe still did not find out who did it.\n\nThe setup was extremely vicious.\n\nLorenzo and Sydney\u2019s relationship turned from true love to pure hatred. They were so miserable for each other that it broke apart Lorenzo and Oliver\u2019s friendship. It also caused Sydney to become mentally ill, miscarrying from extreme heartache...\n\nHowever, she still could not identify the mastermind behind this! Four years ago, Sydney and Oliver searched for a long time but to no avail.\n\nLorenzo left.\n\nSydney stood in the corridor for a long time. She clutched her chest and raced towards the room at the corner of the corridor, calling out with each step, \"Mrs. Harper...\"\n\nHer breath became shorter each time.\n\nWhen she reached the door, she reached out and knocked, then her vision went dark as she fell to the ground unconscious.\n\nThe door opened shortly. The nanny had the shock of her life and quickly picked Sydney up in panic. \"Madam!\"\n\nThe sound of a car driving away was heard downstairs.\n\nSydney regained consciousness after Mrs. Harper gave her first aid.\n\nMrs. Harper had a glass of water and a handful of white pills in her hand. She said, \"Madam, why don't you tell your husband about your condition? If he sympathizes with you because of this, you might...\"\n\nSydney shook her head stubbornly, \"He and I are together because we love each other. I don't want to be pitied.\"\n\nShe took the pills and swallowed them. She closed her eyes and kept silent for a long time, then she said to Mrs. Harper, \"He\u2019s seeing someone else. I want to know who she is. Tell me, is it okay for me to ask his friends?\"\n\n\u2026\n\nMelon, the largest nightclub in Quill City.\n\nMusic was blaring in a VIP room. Lorenzo kicked the door open and went in. The men who were dancing intimately with the women almost soiled their pants.\n\nHowever, no one dared to be angry.\n\nLorenzo was a peculiar legend in Quill City. In his youth, he was an uncivilized and rebellious devil. Despite being a member of the Bailey Group, the wealthiest corporation in Quill City, he was cast out as the black sheep of the family and was dead broke.\n\nLater, his parents could not stand it anymore and made a plan for him to study abroad. He refused without hesitation. Instead, he relied on the prize money he got from a gaming tournament and simply enrolled himself in a vocational school.\n\nSuch a self-destructive person suddenly changed at the age of twenty.\n\nLorenzo became extremely hard-working. He diligently went to class and hung out in the library. He would also dress up and leave the dormitory at around six o'clock every morning. He rode the bicycle for an hour to Quill City Fine Arts Academy for lectures.\n\nSome people claimed that he had fallen in love with a student from Quill City Fine Arts Academy.\n\nNot long after, he wanted to start a company. His family was not supportive, of course. So, he put a knife to Grandpa Bailey\u2019s throat and grabbed 300 million to open a jewelry company, registered as Cherr.y.\n\nAt that time, the Baileys thought that the 300 million was burned for good. However, Cherr.y turned out to be unexpectedly successful. It made ten times the profit in its second year. In the fourth year, it was listed in Newford.\n\nToday, the \u2018Black Sheep\u2019 was a self-made man and had become the heir to the Bailey Group. Cherr.y had become a world-renowned jewelry brand.\n\nAs soon as Lorenzo sat down on the sofa, a group of beauties quickly came over and said, \"Mr. Bailey!\"\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nThe women trembled in fright and scurried away. Two more men sat down and said, \"Lorenzo, what pissed you off at home?\"\n\nLorenzo kept quiet. He picked up a glass and started chugging.\n\nThe others did not say anything anymore. They picked up their glass to drink with him.\n\nNot a moment later, someone's cell phone rang on the table.\n\n\"Xavier, your phone!\"\n\nA handsome man with platinum blond hair sat up on the sofa in a dark hidden corner.\n\nXavier woke up from his nap and scratched his tattooed neck. He took a look at his cell phone and his eyes widened.\n\n\"Lorenzo,\" he looked at Lorenzo, \"Why is Sydney calling me?\"\n\nLorenzo paused mid-drink and looked at Xavier. \"Who?\"\n\nXavier walked up to him with his cell phone, \"Your wife!\"\n\nLorenzo's expression turned sinister. \"When did you get her number?\"\n\nXavier said casually, \"On the day you both got married, I gave her my number when we sang together in the karaoke bar.\"\n\nHearing that, Lorenzo stood up abruptly and grabbed Xavier's collar, \"Who asked you to give your number?\"\n\nXavier frowned, puzzled at his friend\u2019s sudden rage. He pushed Lorenzo's hand away, \"We were all having fun, what\u2019s the big deal in exchanging contact information?\"\n\nLorenzo got angry. \"WHY\"\n\nWith that, he punched the undefended Xavier.\n\nXavier was caught off guard and slammed onto the marble table. The wine and glasses on the table clattered onto the floor.\n\nThe atmosphere froze. Lorenzo's eyes turned red like a furious beast. He growled, \"Delete her number!\"\n\nXavier was no sitting duck either. He was the second generation of the Altmans, an old money family in Quill City.  He was the prodigal son of the Altmans, a notorious troublemaker. He could hang out frequently with Lorenzo because they were similar.\n\nXavier wiped the bleeding corner of his lips and punched Lorenzo in return. \"What's going on, Popeye? Use your words, not your fists!\"\n\nLorenzo was hit on the head. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then he grabbed Xavier, pressed him on the sofa and beat him in a frenzy. \"How many times have you contacted Sydney in the past two years?!!\"\n\nXavier dodged Lorenzo's heavy punches and said, \"Why would I contact your wife like I have nothing else to do?! Have you gone mad? I'll admit you to the mental hospital!\"\n\nThese words seemed to hit a nerve. Lorenzo paused. \n\nHe was stunned for a few seconds. Then, he sat down on the side and then closed his eyes to quell the anger in his heart.\n\nXavier sat up, frowned and rubbed his shoulders. Vulgarities spewed.\n\nLorenzo ignored Xavier. After a while, he calmed down. He opened his eagle eyes and scanned the other men in the room, \"Who else saved her number?\"\n\nImmediately, several men lowered their heads to look for their phones.\n\nLorenzo was startled.\n\nImmediately, terrifying sounds of broken bottles filled the space, as well as Lorenzo's angry swear words, and screams of women as they dodge shards of glass.\n\nLorenzo seemed to have lost his mind and started attacking all his friends.\n\nXavier stepped outside with his cell phone and returned Sydney\u2019s call.\n\nWhen Sydney picked up, Xavier humbly said, \"Hi, Sydney. What's the matter?\"\n\nSydney's voice was gentle and polite. \"Xavier, I'm sorry to bother you. Lorenzo got a little upset with me tonight. He blocked me and I can't contact him. I wanted to ask if you know where he is.\"\n\nChapter 0003\n\"He was drinking with me, and now he's drunk and acting crazy. I'll send him back to you later. Don\u2019t worry.\"\n\nSydney paused for a moment then said, \"Can you give me the address? I want to check on him myself.\"\n\nXavier took a deep breath, opened the door and saw the chaos inside. He said, \"Melon, A.\"\n\nAbout ten minutes later, apart from Lorenzo and Xavier, everyone else left.\n\nLorenzo sat on the sofa. He stared at the chandelier on the ceiling, lost in thoughts.\n\nXavier sat next to him, \"We are not a part of your drama with Sydney. If anything, go home and solve it with her. Don't go crazy here.\"\n\nLorenzo closed his eyes. \"I\u2019m not going home.\"\n\n\"You must,\" \"Then tell me what happened between you two, I\u2019ll find a way for you.\"\n\nLorenzo, \"You can't.\"\n\n\u201cFine,\" Xavier said, \"If you won't go home, where will you go later?\"\n\n\"Chelsea will pick me up.\"\n\nXavier was stunned for a moment. \"Are you okay? You got so anxious when your wife called me. And now you\u2019re going to see another woman?\n\n\"I met you late. I don't know what happened between you and Sydney. You left her alone for two years, acting like you really don't care. However, we are not allowed to keep her contact information. What on earth are you thinking?\"\n\nLorenzo became impatient again. \"Boy, don\u2019t meddle with adult matters.\"\n\nWhen Xavier started to curse, a creaking sound came from the door. The two of them looked towards the door.\n\n\u201cEnzo,\u201d A sweet voice came.\n\nThe woman had the body of a devil and the face of an angel as she slithered in. She was the \u2018Nation\u2019s Goddess\u2019 and top tier actress, Chelsea Dune.\n \nLorenzo's expression finally softened a little when she appeared. \"Here she comes.\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows subtly.\n\nChelsea elegantly sat next to Lorenzo while avoiding the mess on the ground. She saw the cut at the corner of his eye.\n\nThe woman frowned. \"Why are you hurt?\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"It's nothing. I just drank too much.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt?\" As she spoke, Chelsea reached out and took Lorenzo's arm.\n\nXavier said with a smile, \"Hey Superstar, do you know he is married?\"\n\nChelsea paused and retracted her hand in embarrassment. \"Enzo and I are just friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, cool.\"\n\nLorenzo seemed displeased with Xavier's sarcasm towards Chelsea. He retorted, \"What are you trying to say?\"\n\nXavier stuck his tongue in his cheek and stood up with a grin. \"Nothing. Things among you guys are too complicated for my little brain. I\u2019m gonna go home to bed.\"\n\nAs soon as Xavier reached the door, the door was opened from the outside.\n\nXavier paused.\n\nSydney stood timidly at the door.\n\nShe was timid but she was objectively eye-catching.\n\nHer long, dark and wavy hair draped casually down her back. She had light makeup on her delicate and pretty face. Her lips were as bright as cherry, with a hint of sparkle.\n\nThe velvet, burgundy strappy dress contrasted with her flawless, snow-white skin. She was like a blooming red rose in the dark night.\n\nXavier gulped. He forgot how to speak at that moment.\n\nLorenzo's voice was suddenly heard. \"Who\u2019s there?\"\n\nXavier was stunned,and stepped aside to make way for Sydney. After Sydney entered the room, he exhaled and came back to his senses.\n\nAs soon as Sydney reached the door, she froze.\n\nEveryone had left. The private room had the brightest lights turned on. Right in the middle, Lorenzo and Chelsea were sitting together with their arms touching each other. To Sydney, that scene hurt her eyes more than the light.\n\nHer breath was stuck in her throat. Her lips quivered, but she could not say a word.\n\nLorenzo had an affair with Chelsea, her college bully!\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Lorenzo frowned, \"Go back!\"\n\nSydney shuddered then finally took a step. She quickened her pace.\n\nShe went up to the two of them. While everyone was caught off guard, she slapped Chelsea across the face and grabbed her hair. \"It's you!\"\n\nChelsea screamed, \"Ah! Enzo, help me!\"\n\n\u201cSydney!\u201d\n\nWhen Lorenzo spoke, Sydney let go of Chelsea. She raised her hand towards Lorenzo, but did not strike him.\n\nHer hands trembled. She broke down and shouted, \"You clearly know what she did to me back then! Of all the people, why her?!\"\n\nSuddenly.\n\nSlap!\n\nChelsea took advantage when Sydney was unguarded and slapped her back. That slap was even harder than Sydney\u2019s.\n\nSydney felt ringing in her ears, and then blood dripped from the corners of her lips.\n\nChelsea snarled, \"Why blame others if you can't keep your man?!\"\n\nSydney held her face. Her eyes turned red at Chelsea\u2019s smug expression. She shouted, \"I'm taking your life. \n\nShe tried to attack Chelsea again, but Lorenzo stopped her. He grabbed the back of her head and threw her to the other side of the sofa.\n\n\"I told you to go back, are you deaf?\"\n\nSydney felt as if she had gone deaf. The ringing in her ears was so severe that she couldn't hear what Lorenzo said. Half of her head was throbbing.\n\nAt this moment, Chelsea suddenly covered her ears and wailed, \"Enzo, I can't hear!\"\n\nLorenzo was shocked, \"You can\u2019t hear?\"\n\nChelsea's eyes widened in pity, and her cries became louder. \"I can't hear what you said...\"\n\nLorenzo looked back and glared at Sydney fiercely. He stood up, arms over Chelsea and walked out, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier, saw Lorenzo escorting a tearful Chelsea out of the room. He knew something was amiss and quickly entered the room.\n\nSydney closed her eyes and clasped her head with her hands. She fell sideways on the sofa. Her shoulders shook.\n\nAt the moment, half of that bright and charming face was as pale as paper, and the other half was marked with an angry palm print. The blood on the corners of her lips stood out even more.\n\nXavier's eyes widened and he rushed over. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney did not respond.\n\nXavier nudged her gently. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney then opened her eyes, her voice fading away, \"My, my ears hurt...\"\n\nWith the slap mark and her ear hurting, Xavier immediately understood what had happened. He helped Sydney up and said, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\nSydney only managed to take two steps before her legs gave way. She was about to crash.\n\nPeople lose strength when they cannot bear the pain. Sydney would rather die than have Lorenzo cheated on her with Chelsea.\n\nXavier felt a pang of distress. He carried Sydney in his arms and hurried out.\n\n\u2026\n\nLorenzo and Chelsea stopped outside the main entrance of Melon. He said, \"Wait for me here, I'll get the car.\"\n\nChelsea held him and said, \"Enzo, I'm better now. I don\u2019t think I need to go to the hospital. Come with me and stay with me, okay?\"\n\nLorenzo frowned, and just as he was about to agree, something behind Chelsea attracted his attention.\n\nXavier carried Sydney and walked quickly towards the parking lot.\n\nLorenzo frowned, \"Since you don't need to go to the hospital, you should go back to the hotel first.\"\n\nWith that, he turned to chase after Xavier, but Chelsea pulled him back. \"Are you going to look for Sydney? How could she treat you like that but you still can't let her go?\"\n\nChapter 0004\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He did not answer and strode after Xavier.\n\nChelsea exhaled forcefully. Her shoulders trembled. She looked at Sydney and Xavier with clear hatred and jealousy.\n\nHowever, Lorenzo did not manage to intercept Xavier. When he passed by, Xavier's car drifted gorgeously before merging onto the main freeway.\n\n\u2026\n\nInside the car.\n\nSydney crumpled into a ball and leaned against the car window. Xavier fastened the seat belt for her.\n\nTears streamed down her face the whole time, but she was expressionless, like a soulless sculpture.\n\nThe pain in her ear strained the nerves across her head, and pulled out many memories that she did not want to recall.\n\nA group of heavily made-up girls surrounded her. The proudest one leading the pack, was Chelsea, the one with the harmless face.\n\nHer smile was pure evil. She pulled Sydney\u2019s hair, and let her companions take turns to slap her. Chelsea dripped melted white ice cream on Sydney\u2019s face and chest.\n\nSydney dared not resist because her grandmother, Mary Collins, was in the hands of Christopher, Chelsea's father.\n\nThe Dunes were quite wealthy. Christopher owned a ceramics company, and Mary used to work as a cleaner in Christopher\u2019s office building.\n\nMary had always done a good job, but that day Chelsea insisted that Mary accidentally destroyed her father's documents. Even a fool knew that it was all a farce.\n\nSydney was a freshman that year and Chelsea was a sophomore.\n\nAt the Quill City Fine Arts Academy, Chelsea had always been the most sought-after goddess by many in the school. After Sydney entered the school, she stole Chelsea\u2019s glory.\n\nJealousy was written all over Chelsea's innocent face.\n\nChelsea took those humiliating photos and made Sydney look cheap. Soon, other people's harsh words tormented her as well.\n\nSydney, you are so pretty. If You planned turns a resentful woman,would your grandma still need to be a cleaner in her old age to support the family?\n\n\"Sydney! Hey, Sydney!\"\n\nXavier's words pulled her back from her thoughts.\n\nShe turned her head blankly to be met with a pair of gentle, concerned eyes.\n\nXavier saw her motionless and thought she had died with her eyes wide open.\n\nThe speed of the car was fast, and the pressure on her back felt comfortable. Sydney took the pills earlier and felt better because her discomfort was suppressed. Her ears still hurt but she could hear clearly.\n\n\"Xavier, thank you.\"\n\nXavier breathed out, \"As long as you're fine.\"\n\nSydney continued to be silent.\n\nIt was already four o'clock in the middle of the night. There were very few cars on the road.\n\nAfter Xavier turned a corner, he looked back at her.\n\nHis Adam's apple rolled quietly once more.\n\nSydney looked bright and charming from the front, but she looked even more striking with her smooth facial outline and high nose from the side. Her thick eyelashes were naturally curled; It felt like she was God\u2019s favorite.\n\nSydney stood out even among beauties and was considered stunning. She was spotted by a talent scout when she hit puberty in her first year of high school.\n\nHowever, her mother refused to allow her to enter the entertainment industry, so she had been keeping her head down at school. Initially, her mother had strict requirements. Sydney was not allowed to have long hair or wear nice clothes.\n\nThroughout high school, she had ugly short hair and wore puffy, outdated and tacky clothes. She was bullied when she started dressing up in college. It was not until she fell in love with that Black Sheep Enzo that she began to step out of her shell because she had someone to protect her.\n\nXavier broke the silence in the car again. \"You knew that all the boys have only known Lorenzo in the past three or four years. Am I right to say that you and Lorenzo have known each other for a long time?\"\n\nWith that, Sydney said, \"Yeah, he was my first love. I dated him when I was a freshman. He stayed with me throughout my college days for four years. We broke up when I graduated...\"\n\n\"After two years of separation, the elders in our respective families crossed paths by accident, and they arranged for us to get married for some reason. I was willing to get married, but he was not.\"\n\nXavier frowned. \"Do you...love him very much?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Sydney\u2019s voice trembled again, \"He used to be... very good to me. Extremely good.\"\n\nShe was deeply caught up by their love, whereby a simple sentence could dig up those heavy and profound memories.\n\n\"I don't have a father. Lorenzo not only gave me the sense of security that a boyfriend should, but he was protective like a father.\n\n\"For every holiday, others are picked up by their parents, but Lorenzo picked me up. At every start of the school season, parents would send their kids to class, but Lorenzo would send me. The day before school started, he would help me check my luggage. He would make sure I had everything I needed. He would also secretly put money into the pockets of my clothes.\u201d\n\nSydney's tears rolled down her cheeks again as she recalled those memories.\n\nXavier tightened his grip on the steering wheel. His expression became heavy. He did not expect Lorenzo to have such a tender and considerate side.\n\nHowever, tenderness and consideration were the most fearful things in a relationship because trying to move on after a breakup was tantamount to chipping away at the bones.\n\nAfter a moment, Xavier spoke, \"You are now... relying on his past kindness to you to support your marriage.\"\n\nThis sentence summed up her lonely married life for the past two years. Sydney lifted her hand and wiped her eyes, \"I am not willing to lose him. We were so good together; I really can't accept the current situation...\"\n   \n\nXavier said, \"But Sydney, have you ever thought about it? Many couples who have been estranged were once deeply in love in the past. You\u2019ve been tormenting yourself by living in the past. You will definitely meet a man who treats you better in the future.\"\n\nSydney sobbed, \"I tried moving on, but I still can't get over...\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows and changed his approach. \"Chelsea hit you, but he took Chelsea away without concern for you. Can you bear it?\"\n\nSydney was stunned for a moment. The hidden deep affection in her eyes was immediately replaced by hatred as her emotions flared up.\n\n\"No, I told Lorenzo from the start that anyone who is friends with Chelsea is my enemy. Did Lorenzo really have feelings for Chelsea, or did he do it deliberately to spite me...\n\n\"No, I can't think like that either,\" she began to mumble through her chaotic thoughts, \"No matter what his purpose is, if he really slept with Chelsea...\"\n\nShe did not continue, but closed her eyes and began to take deep breaths.\n\nSome scenes were just fantasies, but enough to suffocate her.\n\nXavier's heart ached a little when he saw Sydney in pain. At the same time, he was also curious about what happened between Sydney and Chelsea.\n\nJust as he was about to ask, his cell phone, which he had thrown inside the armrest storage, rang.\n\nHe looked down. It was a call from Lorenzo.\n\nXavier frowned, turned over his phone and clicked to hang up. He glanced in the rearview mirror again.\n\nBehind him was a flashy, black and red car, the world\u2019s rarest supercar. A toy owned by the richest man in Quill City.\n\nXavier looked at Sydney again. Her sobs could really melt a man's heart. He secretly gripped the steering wheel.\n\nIt was not Sydney who gave him her number first. The men, including him, noticed Lorenzo's indifference towards her, but were too captivated by her beauty, so they asked for it behind Lorenzo's back.\n\nOf course, they all found a perfect reason. They asked Sydney to leave her number, so they could contact her for business purposes.\n\nAt that time, no one dared to have filthy intentions. She was Lorenzo's legal wife, and Lorenzo was one of the most outstanding people among his friends.\n\nAside from the fact that Sydney was married, she was indeed a rare beauty. Everyone thought it was harmless to keep a beautiful woman\u2019s phone number.\n\nHowever, things were different now.\n\nHe swerved the steering wheel abruptly and turned around in the opposite direction. He accelerated to 200 miles an hour, and threw Lorenzo off his trail.\n\nChapter 0005\nXavier was driving dangerously fast, but his expression was exceptionally calm.\n\nIn addition to running several companies, he was also a part-time F2 racing driver.\n\nFor Lorenzo, the supercar was just a means of transportation, but in Xavier's hands, it was a toy. He was sure that Lorenzo would not be able to catch up.\n\nLorenzo watched Xavier's car zoom by his car like a ghost. He was stunned for a moment and quickly turned around. Two minutes later, he lost them.\n\nHe continued to call Xavier while flooring the accelerator, but still no one answered.\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier knew that he had other intentions when he ditched Lorenzo, but he dared not show it in front of Sydney right away.\n\nAfter all, she was still Lorenzo's wife. Xavier was one year younger than Lorenzo whom he regarded as his blood brother, so she was his sister-in-law, in a sense.\n\nHe took her to the hospital as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter the medical check-up to make sure there were no major problems, Xavier took Sydney back to Celestial Park after applying ice patches to her face.\n\nCelestial Park was a famous luxury residential area in Quill City. Sydney and Lorenzo bought their marital home here.\n\nAs soon as Sydney got to the bedroom, she saw Lorenzo sitting on the sofa at the end of the bed. There was a bottle of white wine on the round table next to him.\n\nSydney's eyes flashed. Without saying a word, she went to bed, lay down, and closed her eyes.\n\nA few seconds later, the man's footsteps were heard.\n\nSydney shivered. Her eyelashes became wet again.\n\nLorenzo suddenly got on the bed and pressed on her. She opened her eyes and started to push him away. \"Don't touch me...\"\n\nLorenzo paused, grabbed her collar with both hands, and tore her skirt apart.\n\nSydney's eyes widened with shock. Her screams echoed through the bedroom. \"Don't touch me with the hand you used to touch Chelsea Dune!\"\n\nLorenzo froze.\n\nSydney looked at him as tears poured down her face. \"I can have no dignity in front of you because we were dependent on each other for those four years. You provided a great deal for me, and you are also the closest person to me besides my mother and grandmother. My heart breaks for you because you were hurt by what happened back then. I can\u2019t bear to see you in deep pain every day because of me so I allow you to vent your grievances by hurting me!\n\n\u201cBut I can't share the same man with Chelsea, and I can't have the hand that touched her, touch me!!\n\n\u201cShe is the last straw of my dignity, Lorenzo!\"\n\nHowever, these words did not move Lorenzo to show any guilt.\n\nInstead, he became angrier. \"What about my last straw?\"\n\n\"I was disgusted by you too after Oliver touched you. What you do that night when we got registered?\"\n  \nSydney trembled. She choked.\n\nThat night.\n  \nHer mother and mother-in-law both wanted to seize the opportunity so that she and Lorenzo could have a child as soon as possible, so they tampered with their tea.\n\nLorenzo thought it was Sydney who Framed him.\n\n\"Why aren't you talking?\" Lorenzo's eyes were red as he stared into hers, \"Where did Xavier take you? He deliberately didn't answer my call. What did you do?\"\n\n\"Can you stop being suspicious of everyone and anyone? He took me to the hospital!\"\n\n\"Hospital?\" Lorenzo sneered, and he tightened his grip on her clothes, this time tearing her skirt all the way, \"Sydney, lift your legs for me!\"\n\nSydney panicked. \"What are you going to do?!\"\n\n\"Let's see if you betrayed me again!\"\n\nSydney immediately closed her knees together, \"I didn't!\"\n\nLorenzo pressed harder and his voice became more forceful, \"I don't believe a word you said!\"\n\nSuch stubborn words made Sydney lose the will to refute him.\n\nShe looked at Lorenzo\u2019s frightening and gloomy face and felt disgusted with him for the first time.\n\nShe reached out and pinched the back of his hand. \"Let me go, I'm tired, I want to sleep!\"\n\n\"I don't want to sleep, why should you sleep!\" Lorenzo was still furious. He did not seem to feel any pain in the back of his hand. The grip in his hand became stronger and stronger.\n\nHe pulled apart Sydney's knees quickly. He spread her legs apart so hard that even her behinds hurt.\n\nHe was worried that she would resist, so he pressed his knee on her belly and untied his belt.\n\nSydney's tears rolled to the side of her temples and wet the pillow. Still, she said nothing. Since pinching the back of his hand did not work, she pinched his neck hard.\n\nLorenzo winced in pain, but still did not let her go.\n\nIt felt as if he would not give up if he did not test her.\n\nLorenzo's neck,and even his arms and abdominal muscles were left bruised from Sydney's pinching while she gradually lost hope.\n\nShe wilted like dry roses, losing all trace of vitality.\n\nLorenzo endured the pain and tried to control her, but failed.\n\nSydney's tearful eyes trembled. Her hand squeezing his chest loosened, and she finally spoke again, \"Is that enough?\"\n\n\"Enough?\" Unexpectedly, Lorenzo felt even more enraged. He reached out and yanked open the drawer on the bedside table, took out the bottle of essential oil she bought, and then slammed the drawer shut!\n\nSydney seized this opportunity and tried to escape, but he grabbed her ankle in time. \"Be good!\"\n\nSydney stopped resisting. She knew she would not be able to escape tonight.\n\nShe was in tears, but she laughed. \"Lorenzo, I really didn't expect that one day I would be disgusted with you. Go ahead, disgust me more. So I can hate you enough, and give you what you want...\"\n\nShe thought, \u2018Lorenzo should know what I was referring to.\u2019\n\nIn the split second, her refusal to sign the divorce agreement suddenly wavered.\n\nDuring the time between being taken away by Xavier and being sent back home, she had been recalling the past.\n\nWhen she recalled the past with Chelsea, she did not want to lose her self-esteem. However, when she recalled every moment with Lorenzo, she did not want to regret losing the man she loved most.\n\nShe was deeply confused by these opposing feelings.\n\nHowever, right now, she actually felt disgusted with the man she loved most.\n\nShe was glad.\n\nDisgusted by him meant that she could finally let him go one day. \n\nLorenzo's face darkened at Sydney\u2019s words. He could not tell whether he was angry or something else.\n\nShe wanted to say more, but Lorenzo's lips suddenly covered hers.\n\nAt the same time, his fingertips of both hands trailed up along her waistline.\n\nThe faint smell of tobacco mixed with the fragrance and wine was an alluring masculine aroma. In the past, she could never resist his kisses.\n\nLorenzo was even wilder in the past than he is now. He was like a lion in the savanna. The passion and impulse he made her feel was strong and without restraint.\n\nApart from the four years they were separated, they had slept together for four years until now. He understood every part of her body, her preferred tension and pressure.\n\nSoon, her body reacted uncontrollably."

                      "text": "Chapter 1    \nI had thought it would be the most romantic day ever. There were two pieces of good news to celebrate today: my 3rd wedding anniversary and the fact that I'd just gotten a promotion.\nI walk eagerly to the man I love, stretching onto my toes to kiss Ryan. But he ducks, pushing something into my arms.\nWhen I unwrapped it, my whole body froze.\nA divorce document.\n\u201cThat's what I want. \u201c Ryan said coldly. His arms crossed over his chest.\u201d Honestly, I'm sick and tired of this. You're not taking care of our home. \u201d\nIt took me a minute to comprehend the current situation.\u201d It wasn't April Fool's Day. \u201d\nExasperated, Ryan rolls his angry eyes at me and gestures to the room around us. \u201c Do you know what it\u2019s like to walk into a room with cat hair everywhere and a carpet that hasn\u2019t been cleaned in months? \u201d\nMy eyes widen, my head pulling back to look at my husband. \u201cLet me remind you that I make twice as much as you do and that I am the one who pays for the cleaners. Yet, I distinctly remember conversing with you a long time ago where we agreed to take turns dividing our workload!\u201d\nThe counter-argument makes Ryan grunt, throwing his head back as he stares at the ceiling. \u201cI earn money too, Esme!\u201d He snaps at me.\n\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem here?\u201d\n\u201cThe problem? Why don\u2019t I have a housewife? You can\u2019t even be bothered to bring me a child to raise!\u201d\n\u201cMe? You do realize I want to have this baby, too, right? You\u2019re the one who refuses to go with me to the hospital! Maybe if you were a bit more active\u2014\u201d\nRyan interrupts me with a laugh that silences me.\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d He spits, seemingly implying that I\u2019m a liar. \u201cYou\u2019re having an affair with your boss; don\u2019t deny it!\u201d\nMr. Anderson? Derek Anderson? The confusion seems to proliferate, and the facial expressions that take over my face feel like a dream.\nThe only thing that is true about my boss is that he\u2019s a dashing divorced man. I\u2019m dazed at the idea my husband accuses me of sneaking behind his back.\n\u201cI can absolutely assure you, Ryan, that there never has and never will be anything regarding my boss! I am his subordinate, and there\u2019s nothing left to discuss about Mr. Anderson!\u201d\nHis arms cross over his chest again, huffing. \u201cYou\u2019re so delusional that your work has given you everything you desire when, in fact, it is your boss.\u201d\n\u201cFine. You want this divorce and to live in your fantasy world where I\u2019m the villain? I\u2019ll sign your freaking divorce papers, but not right now. For now, I\u2019m going to find a competent lawyer to help me properly divide my property from you.\u201d\nI start rushing toward the front door, needing to escape this house, this man, this absurdity.\nBut I hear Ryan chasing me down the hall. \u201cEsme! Quit stalling for more time or to conjure up new lies. If you have a clean conscience, then you should sign the papers today.\u201d\nHe grabs my arm and whirls me around, and for the first time since I met Ryan, I don\u2019t recognize the man. His eyes are dark, his skin ice cold as his fingers wrap around my upper arm, and his voice full of disgust.\nI shake my head, ripping my arm from his grasp, slap my husband in the face, and I leave the house with papers in hand and my heart bleeding on the floor in front of the man.\nHappy anniversary to me.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to murder the scum!\u201d\nMy best friends, Annie and Lily, sit at the bar on either side of me. Ransom\u2019s Tavern is our favorite place to drown our sorrows, and Lily is basically ready to go all Jeffery Dahmer on Ryan.\n\u201cAnd on your anniversary of all days! Who asks for a divorce on the day two people get married? He better be ready for me because I\u2019m going to end his entire life with one freaking punch to the face!\u201d\nI can\u2019t help but laugh at Lily as she puts up her fists like she\u2019s preparing for battle. Her nose scrunches up, and her eyebrows hide behind her brown bangs.\n\u201cCalm yourself,\u201d Annie instructs our friend.\n\u201cCalm? How can you be calm? He\u2019s just told our best friend that she\u2019s only where she is in her career because she\u2019s been sleeping with her boss! Do you know how incredibly misogynistic and disgusting that is?\u201d\n\u201cTalk louder; I don\u2019t think the entire block heard you,\u201d I reply as I take a drink. This is the last thing I need. I rub my left temple, my curly blonde hair quickly becoming tangled in my fingers.\n\u201cMoving on!\u201d Annie instructs, waving her perfectly manicured hand at Lily. Then, touching my hand on the sticky bar, Annie states seriously, \u201cEsme, if I were you, I\u2019d go to your boss\u2019 house and sleep with him. Now.\u201d\nI roll my eyes as I give the two women a sad smile. \u201cCome on, my boss isn\u2019t like you, guys. He\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s got a lot of responsibilities on his plate.\u201d\n\u201cUh, isn\u2019t your boss single now?\u201d Lily questions.\nI shrug, taking another sip of my watery beer. \u201cHe\u2019s got two daughters, and from what I\u2019ve heard, he takes care of them independently.\u201d\n\u201cAka, he\u2019s single and maybe ready to mingle?\u201d Annie teases, biting her bottom lip at her joke.\nI nudge my shoulder against hers, unable to keep a laugh from rising out of me. \u201cStop it!\u201d\nI wouldn\u2019t be shocked if Anderson is single, especially since he never works overtime. He always leaves as soon as the clock strikes five like Cinderella leaving the ball at midnight.\nBut as I sit here, I start to wonder if the booze has already saturated my mind. Because suddenly, Anderson is all I\u2019m able to think about.\nWho would it hurt if I were to maybe\u2026text him? Ryan would be furious, absolutely floored at my gall. But my anger, my desire to hurt the man who I\u2019d married three years ago, fuels my rage.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to text him,\u201d I tell the girls, pulling out my phone. I\u2019m going to tell him exactly where I am right now and use this to relieve some of the anger.\nGetting back at Ryan for his selfish and pathetic behavior? Better than giving him a swift kick in his special little place.\n\u201cNo way. Prove it!\u201d Annie smirks, looking down at my phone lying on the bar.\nI pick up the phone, typing in Anderson\u2019s name in my messages. I\u2019ll send him my address as if supposedly informing a friend of my whereabouts. Then, after about a minute, I\u2019ll just tell him I\u2019d sent the message to the wrong person.\nNo harm, no foul.\nBesides, it\u2019s already 8:45. It must be parenting time for Anderson.\nI type in the address to Ransom\u2019s Tavern and hit send. I put down the phone, my friends laughing and shoving me with disbelief.\nTo my surprise, my phone buzzes back immediately with a reply.\n\u201cFive minutes.\u201d\n\nChapter 2\n\u201cNo way, no way!\u201d Annie squeals as she grabs my phone from my hands. Her pale blue eyes sparkle with mischief. \u201cLily, he\u2019s coming!\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Lily shouts, reaching across me to take my phone next, pushing a piece of her short brown hair away from her face.\n\u201cThis is absolutely crazy. I can\u2019t even believe it! Five minutes? That\u2019s so fast!\u201d Annie cries, her arm catapulting back for the phone.\n\u201cOh my God, I\u2019m so excited, I can\u2019t wait to see what he looks like!\u201d Lily adds, jumping in her bar seat with excitement.\nThe two of them are growing louder by the second, and now I\u2019m starting to get a headache and regret my message.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you just point out that he\u2019s got two daughters? It\u2019s a school night. He\u2019s probably spending time with the kids,\u201d Lily points out as Annie re-reads the texts for the tenth time.\n\u201cWhat do you think this means?\u201d Annie asks, still staring at my phone.\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll bring them along,\u201d Lily gushes.\nI\u2019m too stunned to say anything. Did I really do this to myself? I can\u2019t even believe it!\nAs if a magic wand is waved over my head, I feel the drunkenness clears up instantly, and now I\u2019m sweating from every possible place I can think of.\n\u201cHe\u2026he must have thought I was contacting him for a work-related matter,\u201d I find myself stammering to the girls. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly dedicated.\u201d\nAnnie shakes her head. \u201cExcept this is outside of work hours, honey. Besides, he knows this is a pub, yet here he is, rushing over like your knight in shining armor!\u201d\nShe and Lily scream again, their bodies jumping up and down in the bar seats as they shake their arms in the air.\nWell, if the drunkenness has left, then bring on the hangover because I am far too sober for this.\nI\u2019m honestly speechless now. My friends must be overthinking things, surely. I mean, Anderson is just so professional in the office. He cares for his subordinates, and I know that.\nBesides, I\u2019ve never messaged him outside of the working hours in the past, so that must have made him inclined to believe it must be something serious.\nEven if that\u2019s not the case, I can\u2019t help but continue panicking in my head over the fact Anderson will be here soon.\nAs the end of the five minutes approaches, Lily and Annie decide to step aside to let me handle this situation on my own. They sit at a table in the back of the bar, watching me like I\u2019m their newest form of entertainment.\nI better come up with a perfect lie. I\u2019m starting to sweat and growing more nervous by the second for Anderson to show up. Maybe something about how work has been a struggle, or I\u2019ve had a few difficult clients?\nAs the thoughts run through my head, they\u2019re quickly sent away when Anderson walks into the bar in an elegant, perfectly tailored suit. His eyes search for me before landing on the bar, and he smiles gently.\nStanding at what I can imagine to be over six feet tall, Derek Anderson is a white yet tanned man in his late thirties with dark brown hair on his head. He has his usual dark smudges under his eyes, which match his exhaustion. He\u2019s also just about one of the most good-looking men I\u2019ve ever seen.\nI quickly scramble to my feet once he enters, realizing I have absolutely no idea what I must look like. A wreck, probably, considering I just got dumped by my own husband. Is my hair okay? What about my makeup?\nOh man, what about my breath?\nAnderson approaches, keeping his smile spread out on his face. I take a deep breath, and tell myself to calm down.\n\u201cCongratulations on your promotion, Esme,\u201d Anderson says once he\u2019s closed the distance. He looks really good tonight.\n\u201cT-Thank you,\u201d I stutter out, trying to keep my composure. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to taking on the new responsibilities.\u201d\nWe both sit at the bar together, still keeping one another in our line of sight.\nI do put a lot of time into my job, and it is genuinely rewarding and fulfilling. I mean, the years I\u2019ve put into it have given me such a rush of pride. But thinking of Ryan\u2019s complaints scratches at the surface of my skin.\n\u201cI brought you a gift to celebrate,\u201d Anderson states, holding out a small bag for me to take from him.\nSurprised, I reached out for the bag. What could he have possibly grabbed for me in the five minutes it took for him to arrive?\n\u201cThank you, Mr. Anderson, that\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d\nHe gestures to the bag. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you open it?\u201d\nI look down at the bag, feeling awkward about opening his gift right here, but do as he asks.\nI can\u2019t contain my absolute shock when I pull the gift out of the bag. A jewelry box?\nI slowly open the box, seeing a beautiful necklace inside. My jaw drops.\n\u201cW-w-what? How did you\u2014?\u201d\nAnderson gives me a sheepish smile, nodding at the box. \u201cI happened to notice your phone\u2019s wallpaper recently, and\u2026\u201d He rubs the back of his neck. \u201cI hope that it wasn\u2019t too personal.\u201d\nI can\u2019t hide my stunned expression. This is so thoughtful of Anderson, and I raise my eyes to his. How do I even thank him for this?\nThe necklace, a beautiful silver chain with a dark blue heart wrapped around it, was supposed to be a gift hint for Ryan to find. I picked it out because I knew how perfect it would match my own dark blue eyes.\nI\u2019ve been eyeing this for weeks and was so, so hopeful he would figure out my desire to own it.\nI\u2019m so confused because this is like my dream wedding anniversary! Though, in reality, it\u2019s all a mess\u2014yet here I stand with my own boss, my eyes wide and mouth agape as I hold onto the beautiful jewelry.\nThis is Anderson handing over this gift, though. Not my own husband.\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting a divorce!\u201d I blurt out without a thought.\nMy boss\u2019s expression morphs, and he gives off a strange expression. \u201cSorry?\u201d He questions.\nAt this very moment, I notice something pink on the corner of Anderson\u2019s suit. Is that\u2026Peppa Pig? A sticker?\nGod, what the heck am I doing? This is my boss! He\u2019s a mature man with children and professional conduct. A full-fledged, single father with no need for some random employee to take up his incredibly important time.\nI take one deep breath, then another. Calm down a second. This day has been such a whirlwind that I must have gotten swept up in the kind gesture from Anderson.\nMy nerves are growing, and I feel inexplicably and desperately wanting to escape this incredibly awkward situation. My personal life doesn\u2019t need to be brought up in front of Anderson, so what am I doing talking to him like we\u2019re old friends catching up?\nOut of professionalism, it\u2019s imperative that my personal matters are handled privately and have nothing to do with him. What am I even doing calling him to the bar and divulging that I\u2019m leaving Ryan behind?\nAbruptly, I make my voice sound natural, though it doesn\u2019t feel as such. \u201cWhat I meant to say was,\u201d I start, another breath to calm myself. \u201cI\u2019d like to request time off.\u201d\nAnderson raises his left eyebrow.\nI nearly cough. \u201cI need to handle the\u2026related paperwork, if that\u2019s okay, sir?\u201d\nIt feels like a bowling ball has landed on my chest as I watch his expression go unchanging. God, of all the times, to sound like a complete bumbling mess, it has to be in front of my boss.\n\nChapter 3\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d Anderson asks after the silence becomes too stuffy. He\u2019s frowning slightly, and I notice his posture slightly worsen.\nIn my head, I\u2019m thinking, What else? After all, when he arrived, he had no clue about my fight with Ryan. Does he even know today was our anniversary?\nFor some reason, as I continue to stare at the man, I feel a sense of something. Is it\u2026disappointment? Why?\nInstead of probing him with more questions, I nod my head up at the tall man. His eyes, dark and honestly somewhat mysterious, crash against my skin like a hot laser burning into me.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all, yes,\u201d I finally reply.\nI look at Anderson, and then my eyes drift over to Annie and Lily in the corner of the bar. They\u2019re watching so intensely you\u2019d think they've never seen two people interact before. I feel severe discomfort with their daggers.\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Anderson says, straightening his suit jacket. \u201cYour time off is approved. If there is anything else I can do for you, please let me know.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I say to him, wanting to give a smile but struggling to let myself give one away. He\u2019s a kind man, and I appreciate his understanding.\n\u201cOf course. Though, I have one more question, Esme.\u201d\nI turn my head to the side at the statement.\n\u201cAre you here alone tonight?\u201d Anderson\u2019s voice seems to warble a bit, and it throws me off for a moment. Did it matter if I\u2019m here by myself or not?\nNot wanting to lie but still feeling a bit nervous, I nod my head again. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d\nAnderson stands back up to depart, wiping something off of his jacket. As he does this, a waiter comes up to me and deposits a drink in front of me.\n\u201cOh, no, I didn\u2019t order\u2014\u201d I start to say, unsure where this mystery drink came from.\n\u201cCharge it double and put it on my tab,\u201d Anderson deadpans, handing over his card to the waiter, who quickly swipes it through and gives it back.\n\u201cSir, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d\nBefore I can speak, Anderson returns the card to his pocket. \u201cGoodnight, Esme. I hope your paperwork is sorted out shortly.\u201d\n\u201cBut sir, you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d I\u2019m sputtering, but he holds up his hand to stop my sentence again.\n\u201cEnjoy your night.\u201d\nAnderson then walks out of the bar alone, and I can\u2019t help but stare in disbelief at the man as he disappears behind the walls. What the heck just happened?\nThat was all so weird, and I\u2019m struggling to find any words to say now that I\u2019ve been left alone at the bar.\nIt takes another few seconds, but Annie and Lily come rushing over with bright eyes. I can tell the two are ready to start interrogating me for what happened between us, but in truth, I don\u2019t have any words for them.\nInstead, all I can do is gesture with my hands at what is before me. The necklace, the drink, and my confusion are all present.\nI want to tell them I don\u2019t know what happened, but I think my face is saying that enough. Because I don\u2019t know anything. This was all just\u2026random?\nLily, snickering to herself, mimics Anderson under her breath with her large smile. \u201cI\u2019ll pay double.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d Annie pushes, and I just shrug.\n\u201cOh, come on! He walks in here and hands you some fancy jewelry and then hands over his card without even knowing what you\u2019re drinking. That was him clearly flirting!\u201d Lily says dreamily.\n\u201cHardly,\u201d my voice croaks.\n\u201cHow many men would come into this bar and do the exact same thing, though, Esme?\u201d Annie insists. \u201cThat man just swept you off your feet!\u201d\nI look at the door where Anderson exited, wanting to ask him what is going through his head. But that\u2019s the issue. Now he\u2019s left again, and I\u2019m left wondering what this day has turned into.\nA freaking fiasco, for sure.\nLater, after finally getting Lily and Annie to let me leave the bar and return home, I climb into my empty bed.\nAlone for the first time in years, I feel helpless over my foreseeable future. It\u2019s hard to judge whether things will be good or not with Ryan already pushing and shoving his way out the door.\nWhat am I supposed to do about all of this? Today should have been perfect. Ryan could have swept me off my feet, and we could have had a romantic dinner together, shared gifts and kisses and laughter, and enjoyed ourselves. Instead, here I am, holding back tears against my pillow.\nI got a promotion, and on my wedding anniversary at the age of 30, I\u2019m about to lose my marriage. What\u2019s worse is I\u2019m still childless, which causes my heart to strain. I don\u2019t want that label. I don\u2019t want that nightmare.\nNow, I\u2019m going to be the divorced single woman everywhere I try to go.\nOr, maybe, a single, divorced career woman.\nThough, that seems to be even more stressful than the divorced woman label.\nI shake my head out on the pillow, throwing my face into the sheet. This is all happening so bloody fast that I\u2019m unsure what else to do.\nAnd on top of everything bad that\u2019s happened today, I can\u2019t stop replaying Anderson\u2019s facial expressions and kindness toward me. He\u2019s a genuinely kind individual, so having him attempt to comfort me was sympathetic.\nI can\u2019t imagine Ryan doing the same for me, even if we are still married. His compassionate side has never been his strong suit.\nThen again, maybe I\u2019ve just been wearing rose-tinted glasses the whole time, and he was never a good husband to begin with. I guess it\u2019s possible to be lost in a world of love.\nGrunting and rolling over to get out of bed, I realize that sleep shall continue to evade unless I do something about it.\nGrabbing my wallet and a light jacket to cover my pajamas, I finally exit my place, trudging downstairs and out into the world to fix this incredibly horrid headache and insomnia.\nAround the corner from my place is a 24-hour convenience store. Maybe the clinic will have the meds I\u2019m looking for. Regardless, I\u2019m so over this day, and I just want to sleep and have it be tomorrow.\nThe best way forward is through, after all.\nI shuffle into the clinic, making my way to the medication section. I tend to pick up whatever the strongest medications happen to be on the shelf.\nAt this rate, they\u2019re going to need to make a simple medication to calm my anxiety, too.\nMaybe I should go back to the doctor. My insomnia hasn\u2019t really corrupted my sleep and made me this tired in years. But clearly, I\u2019ll be struggling for the foreseeable future.\nI shuffle into the next aisle to grab a large bottle of water to take with my meds. As I get to the front of the store to pay for my supplies, I hear a voice I recognize.\n\u201cIs this the right one, you think?\u201d He asks another person nearby.\nI stretch my neck, seeing the one person I\u2019m desperately trying not to think about.\nI see the short haired blonde first, and I\u2019m surprised to see Ryan standing in the aisle just to the left of me. Then, I hear a second voice.\n\u201cMaybe we get this one,\u201d she replies.\nI narrow my eyes, and as I thank the man at the counter, I walk over to the two people.\nIt\u2019s Ryan alright, but the person he\u2019s with?\nMy cousin, Melinda. With her picture-perfect beauty and her short black hair pulled into a pathetic excuse for a ponytail, I look at the two of them down the aisle.\nAnd the object they\u2019re talking about is a freaking test stick?\n\nChapter 4\n\u201cYou really had to do this to me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Melinda complains as they pick up another stick to examine. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have used protection before you got the divorce?\u201d\n\u201cBabe, it\u2019s going to be fine because we\u2019re going to be divorced soon! Esme\u2014that freaking foolish woman\u2014she\u2019s got no idea about us! Besides, she\u2019s got significantly more savings than I do, and soon, we\u2019re going to inherit a fortune!\u201d\n\u201cYou better hope so, dummy,\u201d Melinda grunts as she turns the pink box over in her hands. \u201cThis is stressing me out.\u201d\n\u201cLook, we\u2019ll inherit the money, we\u2019ll be rich, and you and I will be together. You should get knocked up immediately, unlike Esme. She can\u2019t even have kids!\u201d\nI feel my heart turn cold, my skin burns, and my anger blinds me. This cheater! This whole time, I thought our main issue was over not having children!\nMy fingers strain around the bottles I hold, and a million different things cross my mind to screech at these two people; people I trusted!\nThis entire marriage has never hindered kids; it\u2019s only ever been for Ryan to divorce me and take my money! That spineless, pathetic scum.\n\u201cMelinda! What the heck?\u201d I screech at the two, giving away my position. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you got into bed with him!\u201d\nThe two of them turn to look at me, eyebrows raised, and, at least in my cousin\u2019s face, a slight hint of fear.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Ryan demands.\n\u201cHearing you plan your new life.\u201d I glower at my soon-to-be ex-husband. \u201cYou really think I\u2019m this foolish?\u201d\n\u201cOh no, I don\u2019t think it, I know it!\u201d Ryan retorts back.\nI look straight at my cousin, my eyes falling into slits as I speak the truth. \u201cI don\u2019t have children. No. But maybe that\u2019s because this man\u2019s got useless seeds.\u201d\nI jab a finger in Ryan\u2019s direction. \u201cI won\u2019t let you parasites take a single penny from me! This is freaking war.\u201d\nI stomp out of the pharmacy with a new purpose and officially wide awake. I\u2019m not letting this ship go down. Just the opposite: I\u2019m going to ruin their lives.\nI\u2019m getting a lawyer, gathering all the evidence, and I\u2019m taking them down every peg possible.\nBut first, I need to move out of this place. The thought of Ryan and Melinda doing it in my bed makes me want to vomit.\nI spend the night putting together what I can find, refusing to let sleep take me away from my work.\nOnce the sun comes up, I start chugging coffee, heading into the office to ask if any of my colleagues know anything about nearby rental options.\nI let myself get lost in my job and rental searches, frantic as I let the day whiz by me. It\u2019s not until I stop for a moment in the daze of anger and work that I realize two things:\nThe first one is that I told Anderson I needed time off, and I still came into the office today.\nThe second one is that it\u2019s almost five, and I have two messages from my boss asking me to come to his office when I have a moment.\n\u201cHeck!\u201d I whisper. I stand up abruptly, grab my phone, and throw it into my pocket, rushing down the hall to Anderson\u2019s office. God, this is going to look really weird, isn\u2019t it?\nI knock on the door and straighten myself out, but in my head, I know I\u2019m going to look like a mess.\n\u201cCome in,\u201d I hear Anderson call, and I slowly open the door.\n\u201cHi,\u201d I say shyly, moving forward into the room.\n\u201cAh, Esme,\u201d he smiles. He gestures at me. \u201cCome in, close the door behind you.\u201d\nOh God, am I being fired?\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, I didn\u2019t see your messages until just now. I was busy with my work.\u201d\nHe nods but tells me to sit down. \u201cNo problem, I just wanted to discuss something with you.\u201d\nThe moment my body touches the soft cushion of the chair, I\u2019m quick to explain. \u201cI completely forgot that I\u2019d asked for time off, and then I didn\u2019t even remember until I read your messages! I\u2019m so sorry for\u2014\u201d\nHe holds up a hand to stop me, and I listen, confused. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I called you in here.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d I say, shrinking into the chair. If I could just disappear into thin air right now, that\u2019d be wonderful.\n\u201cI did, however, want to ask you if you\u2019re alright. You do seem a bit\u2026tense.\u201d\nI need the power of invisibility right about now.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I lie.\n\u201cAnd the conversations around the office about you looking for rental options?\u201d\nHeck, I\u2019ve been caught.\n\u201cAre you looking for a place, Esme?\u201d He asks again.\nHe must have listened in on one of those conversations because I only spoke to a few people, and they were relatively short ones.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, really, I hope you can understand that this has been a difficult time for me. I\u2019m sorry for discussing personal matters during work hours.\u201d\nHe raises his hands to me to calm me.\n\u201cEsme, take a breath. It\u2019s fine; we have a comprehensive employee care system.\u201d Anderson gives me a deep look, seemingly looking for something. \u201cConsidering your\u2026special situation, the company has some housing allowances for employees.\u201d\nI sit up straighter. \u201cReally?\u201d\nThe man nods. \u201cYes.\u201d\nI let a long sigh out. \u201cOh, wow, okay, thank you, sir. And thank you for not telling anyone about the divorce. I haven\u2019t told anyone, and I\u2019m not exactly ready for the entire thing to go public.\u201d\nHe nods again. \u201cThat\u2019s tough, and I understand.\u201d\nI feel compelled to apologize again; this information on the housing is incredibly helpful, and I\u2019m so sleep-deprived that it actually seems like a good idea to shake his hand and give him a hug.\nGet your things together, Esme.\nHis small smile and that nod, however, make me feel a special spark ripple through me. Finally, someone understands and has given me the best encouragement I\u2019ve received yet.\nI\u2019m so grateful for his kindness, but a few tears prickle the corners of my eyes. Something about his stature and genuine concern for my well-being and home life makes me feel closer to Anderson than to my own friends.\n\u201cI appreciate the information and for everything you\u2019ve done for me, sir.\u201d\n\u201cMy best employee deserves to know that she is a valuable member to the team. If you\u2019re not in top fighting shape, then we all lose, correct?\u201d\nI nod vigorously. \u201cOf course, yes.\u201d\n\u201cVery well. Go speak to Mrs. Halloway on the third floor about your housing request, and she should be able to get everything sorted out for you today. Hurry, though, she\u2019ll be leaving any minute.\u201d\nI jump up, and without really thinking, I get moving, calling over my shoulder my appreciation once more.\nAs I rush down the stairs, I remind myself that Anderson is also divorced. He\u2019s even got two little girls to take care of. Maybe, this is a shared sympathy?\nHe must know the torture I\u2019ve been enduring since Ryan\u2019s heinous words last night. A divorce is a painful process.\nI believe, however, that my situation is guaranteed worse than anyone will know.\nI manage to catch Mrs. Halloway as she\u2019s putting her papers together to leave. She is kind enough to sit with me for twenty minutes after five as we sign papers, and I\u2019m given the keys to a new apartment to live in.\nI call Annie and Lily in hopes the two women can help me move out tonight. The sooner I\u2019m out of this place, the better.\nAs we\u2019re putting my things into boxes as quickly as possible, the girls prod me with a bunch of questions.\nClearly, everything is moving quickly to them.\n\u201cYou said this is company-provided housing?\u201d Annie asks, incredulous.\n\nChapter 5\nI smile, pushing some curly blonde hair behind my ear and out of my eyes. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d\n\u201cHow much is your rent going to cost?\u201d Lily jumps in.\nI think for a second, putting books into another box. \u201cUh, about two thousand.\u201d\nLily throws a pillow at me, pursing her red lips in my direction as she waves her arms around in the air. \u201cI\u2019m going to murder you!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I laugh, unsure what she\u2019s talking about.\n\u201cI never envied your promotion; everyone knows how hard you work. If I worked late like you, my face would collapse!\u201d\nAnnie says, \u201cBut this, I cannot forgive you for!\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I question, hands on my waist.\nThe two girls look at one another before returning their gazes to me.\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Annie replies, rolling her eyes.\n\u201cCity center,\u201d Lily ticks on her finger.\n\u201cOne thousand square meters,\u201d Annie says next.\n\u201cFully furnished apartment.\u201d\n\u201cSwimming pool, security, a gym downstairs.\u201d\n\u201cOnly 100 meters from the closest shopping center!\u201d\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to kick you out after you\u2019ve signed the contract.\u201d Lily crosses her arms with a satisfying smirk on her face.\nI roll my eyes and sigh but understand they\u2019re having fun at my expense. \u201cGirls, this is the employee care system, okay? I\u2019m getting a divorce.\u201d\nI point at Lily. \u201cAnd you? With one handsome boyfriend after another.\u201d Then, I point at the tall blonde. \u201cAnd you, with a husband that absolutely adores you! Life is fair for the two of you, and there\u2019s no need to be jealous of my pathetic life.\u201d\nI let myself fall to the ground with my legs crossed, exhausted.\nAnnie approaches me, her hand on my shoulder. \u201cWe know, hon,\u201d she reassures me.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re sorry you\u2019re going through all of this right now,\u201d Lily adds, joining us on the floor.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to keep you as happy as we can,\u201d the first woman insists. \u201cYou\u2019re our best friend, Esme, and we just want you to smile.\u201d\nI take both girls around the shoulders and hold them close, so thankful to have the two greatest friends on the planet.\n\u201cWhat the heck would I do without you two?\u201d\nLily shrugs against my embrace. \u201cYou\u2019d probably be packing this place by yourself?\u201d\nAnnie nods matter-of-factly. \u201cAlso, no one would be here to taunt you.\u201d\n\u201cOr remind you that Ryan\u2019s a loser, and you\u2019re a thousand times better off without him!\u201d\n\u201cPlus, then you\u2019d have no one to invite to your new, beautiful, stunning apartment!\u201d Annie finishes, clapping her hands together as I let them both go.\n\u201cYou two are absolutely ridiculous!\u201d I roll my eyes.\n\u201cBut you love us!\u201d They sing song together.\nIt takes only a few hours of rushed packing to get out of the house I\u2019ve lived in for the past several years. I look around one more time once the girls have left, saying goodbye to pieces of my home that will no longer be mine.\nThe perfect window perch to look out at the view around me.\nThe spot on the wooded living room floor where I\u2019d spilled just a touch of black nail polish.\nThe perfect shower and bath combo that I used to lie in for hours at a time enjoying the calm.\nThe walk-in closet is mostly barren now.\nThe steps that I\u2019d tripped down the first time I got a promotion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to say goodbye,\u201d I whisper to the house. The creaks and the shadows that I\u2019ve grown so used to will just become a faded memory. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d\nA creak in the ceiling sounds as if the home is replying to my final words.\n\u201cThank you for these past few years,\u201d I finish, standing in the middle of the living room and taking one final deep breath in.\nThen, I take off my wedding ring and place it on the kitchen table next to my house key. This is it. This is the end of my story here.\nI grab my car keys off the counter by the front door, take one more look around, and then I finally make my exit, knowing there\u2019s no chance I\u2019ll ever walk through this door again.\nI\u2019m no longer Esme, Ryan\u2019s wife.\nNow I\u2019m Esme, a strong, independent woman who is relearning the world around her.\n\u201cYou took your sweet time,\u201d Lily taunts as I finally get into my car downstairs.\n\u201cJust needed to say goodbye,\u201d I insist.\n\u201cOnly you would say goodbye to a freaking house,\u201d Annie says, poking my arm from the passenger seat. Her nails are white today, and I swat her hand away.\n\u201cLet\u2019s gooo, come on!\u201d Lily cries, holding out the second word to annoy us. She jumps up and down in the backseat. \u201cOnward to new adventures, Esme!\u201d\nThe drive to the new apartment isn\u2019t too far. It\u2019s about ten minutes away from the house, and surprisingly, it\u2019s pretty close to our favorite dive, Ransom\u2019s Tavern. That\u2019s pretty perfect since it\u2019s the middle point for all three of us.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Annie whispers as she looks out the window on her side of the car. \u201cLook how beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you said the city center, you really meant it,\u201d I reply to the two, leaning forward in my car to see the apartment building as it towers over us.\n\u201cThe name fits well, too,\u201d Lily adds, pointing out the window ahead of us. I follow her gaze as I see the plaque.\n\u201cCenter City Apartments.\u201d\n\u201cThis is nuts,\u201d I say without really thinking about it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling us,\u201d Lily huffs. \u201cHeck, Esme.\u201d\nWe get a parking spot to the elevators closest to where my unit is supposed to be, and the girls and I start planning our attack.\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s get the important stuff into the bedroom first, and then we\u2019ll grab everything else and put it in the living room,\u201d I instruct.\n\u201cGood plan,\u201d Annie nods, pulling her straight, blonde hair into a ponytail.\nWe spend about an hour just bringing things up to the apartment, moving quickly and laughing with one another about how dumb we all look doing this.\n\u201cHire movers next time!\u201d Lily grunts as she drops a box of clothes on the ground. \u201cIf I\u2019d known this was how I was spending tonight, I\u2019d have told you I was busy!\u201d\nAnnie bumps our friend as she walks by with another box of pictures and memorabilia. \u201cAt least if she hired movers, they\u2019d probably be hot!\u201d\nLily gasps. \u201cOh God, yes! They\u2019d probably be all hot and sweaty and look amazing. Instead, I stink, and I\u2019m tired and hungry!\u201d\nI throw the closest object at Lily, which just so happens to be my car keys. \u201cYou love me, and you\u2019d never leave me in the lurch.\u201d\nAnnie and Lily both shrug at the same time, and the three of us head back to the car for the final round of transferring my stuff.\nOnce we\u2019re done, the two girls decide to utilize the fully furnished couches, but I end up kicking them out so they can each go home and spend time with their men.\n\u201cCall us later if you need some talk therapy?\u201d Annie asks.\nI give her a hug. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me, I\u2019ll be sleeping for the next four days,\u201d Lily deadpans, so I shove her playfully before giving her a hug and watching the two head off together.\nI look around the apartment, not sure where to start. Maybe the best step is to be neighborly and go greet the people who live next store.\nI head out of the door and go to put my new key in my side pocket. However, I accidentally drop the metal onto the ground and crouch down to pick it up.\nSuddenly, as I\u2019m picking up the key, a little missile comes barreling toward me, and the blur crashes into my arms before falling to the ground.\nInstincts take over, and I quickly pick up the small child, an adorable little girl with dark hair. Instantly, she begins to cry as I hold her close and stand back up.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay!\u201d I tell her, bouncing her. \u201cDon\u2019t cry!\u201d\nI look around for an adult, but I\u2019m only met with another girl, a few years older than the first, who looks like a carbon copy. However, she is glaring at me.\n\u201cHow dare you make my sister cry!\u201d She shouts out. \u201cI\u2019m telling my dad on you!\u201d\nThen, as the older girl is yelling, a man in a bathrobe comes running out of the apartment next door, calling out his apologies for his daughter scaring me.\nThe first thing I see is a set of perfect abs, and I have a hard time pulling away from the sight. Wow, what a handsome set of abs.\nMy eyes move up from the abs to the eyes of the tall, tanned man. He looks incredibly relaxed and handsome as he stands in front of me, but it takes me about five seconds longer than it should to put it together.\nI can\u2019t help but gulp as I set down the girl in my arms.\nMy boss\u2026he\u2019s my neighbor?!"

                      "text": "Chapter 0001\nIt was ten o'clock in the evening. Sydney Castro sat in front of the dressing table, rubbing essential oils on her body for that glowing skin.\n\nClearly, she was getting ready to please a man.\n\nHer husband, whom she had not seen for two years, was returning to Somerland today. She missed him terribly.\n\nSydney oiled every part of her body until she was soft and smooth. Then she put on a white, furry lingerie set with a cheeky little cat tail on the small of her back.\n\nIn truth, she did not have to go to such trouble in the past. Lorenzo had wished he could stick to her every day, but after that fateful day, everything changed.\n\nShe went from being his closest lover to the woman he hated the most.\n\nLater, their elders arranged for them to get married. However, Lorenzo was so reluctant that he left the country the day after signing their marriage certificate.\n\nNow two years have passed, during which he only contacted her once. It was six months after her mother's death that he sent her a divorce agreement.\n\nSydney did not sign the papers. She still harbored thoughts of rekindling her marriage with Lorenzo.\n\nHowever, it was difficult.\n\nShe was not even aware he was returning tonight. She only found out when she saw Lorenzo\u2019s friends posted about their drinking session on social media.\n\nLater, she called her mother-in-law, who helped her and sent a driver to bring Lorenzo back.\n\nThe driver called. Lorenzo would be home in a few minutes.\n\nShe had to seize this opportunity and try to rekindle their old flame again.\n\nIntentionally dressed up, she knelt on fours by the bed, evenly distributing the rose petals that had been sprinkled on the bed in advance. She was so engrossed that she did not notice a long shadow walking in.\n\nSuddenly, Sydney\u2019s cat tail was yanked hard as a hot-blooded torso pressed on her back. Her heart skipped a beat. She turned back and came face-to-face with a deep yet intense set of piercing eyes.\n\n\"Enzo...\" she began delicately, \"You finally came...\" Back.\n\nThe rest of her sentence was choked back by a kiss reeking of ethanol.\n\nSydney's eyelashes fluttered as her body responded to his. She was not sure whether Lorenzo was drunk or if her outfit tonight was a success. \n\nLorenzo kissed her so passionately that he wanted to suck her lips swollen. He placed his hands over her waist , grabbing them vigorously.\n\nThe man seemed satisfied. While taking a breath, he growled in a whisper. \"good...\"\n\nGrowling in a whisper was considered flirting. That was Lorenzo\u2019s special habit. \n\nRecently, she had been doing yoga. Her figure was way better than two years ago. This was also a surprise for Lorenzo. His words and actions ignited the fire in her heart.\n\nHer plump waist rose and fell violently. Her rapid breath escaped her rosy lips. Her glowy, fair hands explored his waist through his custom silk shirt, caressing his hard and steamy muscles for the first time in a long time. She hurriedly unbuttoned his shirt.\n\nThe smooth material slid down his strong arms. She unbuckled his belt and wrapped her legs around his waist.\n\nEight years of familiarity with each other made them very compatible in bed. No need for any fluff, they went straight into it.\n\nPerhaps it was because they had not seen each other for too long. His desire seemed to be even more intense than hers, just like when he first tasted the forbidden fruit eight years ago. The man was excited and tireless.\n\nThis went on for more than three hours. Finally, he was satisfied.\n\nSydney laid on the man's beautiful sculpted chest and kissed his handsome face obsessively, trying to make up for lost time.\n\nLorenzo kept his eyes closed, allowing her kisses.\n\n \"I'm very pleased with you tonight.\"Lorenzo said\n\nSydney smiled and kissed the corner of his lips again.\n\nLorenzo raised the corners of his lips. He grabbed her waist hard, and turned over to hold her down.\n\nSydney was sure that he was in a good mood now.\n\nShe stretched out her hand to rub his Adam's apple. Right before they did it again, she said bluntly, \"Enzo, four years ago\u2026I swear nothing happened between Oliver and I. My body and soul completely belong to you. You are finally back. Can we please forget what happened that day and move forward together?\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the smile on the man's face froze instantly.\n\nLorenzo raised his hand and grabbed Sydney\u2019s throat. \n\nSydney's heart skipped a beat. She widened her eyes in panic. It was over. She had said the wrong thing.\n\nThis happened twice before. If she mentioned the words \"four years ago\", Lorenzo would immediately become ruthless and sinister.\n\nHer best friend once said that Lorenzo's reaction was akin to PTSD, a post-traumatic stress reaction.\n\nShe had doubts at the time, and it turned out to be the same today, which proved that her best friend was right.\n\nIn a daze, she heard Lorenzo say, \"Move forward with me? You?\n\n\"I touched you tonight because I'm afraid that you,  wouldn\u2019t change your disgusting habit and sleep with my friends again!\"\n\n\"I won't, I didn\u2019t...\" Sydney explained and reached out to touch his hand, attempting to soothe him.\n\nLorenzo's hand tightened, \"Don't touch me!\"\n\nSydney's face was red from Lorenzo\u2019s grip on her throat.\n\nLorenzo took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. \"You'd better sign the divorce agreement as soon as possible. The past love we had will never be rekindled.\"\n\n The words \u2018divorce agreement\u2019 stabbed Sydney\u2019s heart like a sword. She looked up anxiously, and said with difficulty, \"We were so good back then. Are you going to completely deny all that I\u2019ve done for you, just because of that incident?\n\n\"Oliver and I both explained back then that nothing happened to us. We were set up!\"\n\nHowever, the more she explained, the angrier Lorenzo became. His hand went up her neck and grabbed her chin. The force in his grip became stronger and stronger. Sydney could feel that he wanted to crush her chin.\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\nHe ignored her cries of pain.\n\n\"Set up? Lying on the same bed with him might be a set up, but what about the child in your belly?\"\n\n\"Sydney, I wanted so badly for that baby to be mine at that time... But all the hospitals we went to in Quill City showed the same result: You were fifteen days conceived a baby.!\n\n\"I was on a business trip for two months and you were fifteen days conceived a baby. How could you make me believe that nothing happened between you and him?!\"\n\nAfter that, Lorenzo shook her off.\n\nSydney fell on the pillow. She straightened her messy hair, stood up again and explained shakily, \"But the first doctor I consulted was a traditional medicine practitioner. The old doctor said that I was two months conceived a baby. I didn't tell you immediately because I wanted to wait for you to come back to give you a surprise!\n\n\"You\u2019ve met that old doctor too. He showed you the prescription he gave me with the time written on it. Why won't you...\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Lorenzo interrupted her, \"Handwritten time has no credibility, and it's easier to bribe an old traditional medicine practitioner. Stop now and shut up!\"\n\nShe stood in his shoes and could understand the hurt in his heart. However, she still felt heartbroken from how he decisively shunned her.\n\nEspecially their child. The rejection was heartbreakingly painful.\n\nShe knew it was useless to say anything, so she kept quiet and shed tears of frustration.\n\nLorenzo got out of bed and made a phone call.\n\nThe room was quiet. As the call connected, Sydney heard the voice on the other end. She quickly got out of bed.\n\nA woman\u2019s voice. \"Mr. Bailey\u2026\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"Are you still here?\"\n\nWoman, \"Yes, do you want to come over?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lorenzo said and hung up the phone. \n\nSydney held him back. Her eyes widened with tears and her voice trembled. \"Are you seeing someone else?\"\n\nChapter 0002\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\nSydney\u2019s world collapsed as she burst into tears. \"When did it happen?! Who is she?!\"\n\nShe looked utterly miserable now. Lorenzo had no mercy, he might have even felt a little pleasure seeing her in pain.\n\n\"Can\u2019t stand seeing me with someone else?\"\n\nYes, she could not stand it.\n\nLoving a person would inherently make one possessive. Lorenzo meant so much to her that she could not accept losing him.\n\nAt this moment, the way she was just speechlessly hyperventilating due to the blow was more pathetic than crying. It felt like she was falling to pieces.\n\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He got dressed and left the bedroom.\n\nSydney refused to give up and chased after him. \"Why won\u2019t you believe that I was set up?\"\n\nLorenzo stopped and turned around. \"Then tell me, who set you up?\"\n\nThe corridor of the mansion was wide and long. Sydney was speechless as she looked at the lanky man in white shirt and trousers.    \n\nFour years ago, they talked about this many times. Each time they got stuck here.\n\nExactly.\n\nShe still did not find out who did it.\n\nThe setup was extremely vicious.\n\nLorenzo and Sydney\u2019s relationship turned from true love to pure hatred. They were so miserable for each other that it broke apart Lorenzo and Oliver\u2019s friendship. It also caused Sydney to become mentally ill, miscarrying from extreme heartache...\n\nHowever, she still could not identify the mastermind behind this! Four years ago, Sydney and Oliver searched for a long time but to no avail.\n\nLorenzo left.\n\nSydney stood in the corridor for a long time. She clutched her chest and raced towards the room at the corner of the corridor, calling out with each step, \"Mrs. Harper...\"\n\nHer breath became shorter each time.\n\nWhen she reached the door, she reached out and knocked, then her vision went dark as she fell to the ground unconscious.\n\nThe door opened shortly. The nanny had the shock of her life and quickly picked Sydney up in panic. \"Madam!\"\n\nThe sound of a car driving away was heard downstairs.\n\nSydney regained consciousness after Mrs. Harper gave her first aid.\n\nMrs. Harper had a glass of water and a handful of white pills in her hand. She said, \"Madam, why don't you tell your husband about your condition? If he sympathizes with you because of this, you might...\"\n\nSydney shook her head stubbornly, \"He and I are together because we love each other. I don't want to be pitied.\"\n\nShe took the pills and swallowed them. She closed her eyes and kept silent for a long time, then she said to Mrs. Harper, \"He\u2019s seeing someone else. I want to know who she is. Tell me, is it okay for me to ask his friends?\"\n\n\u2026\n\nMelon, the largest nightclub in Quill City.\n\nMusic was blaring in a VIP room. Lorenzo kicked the door open and went in. The men who were dancing intimately with the women almost soiled their pants.\n\nHowever, no one dared to be angry.\n\nLorenzo was a peculiar legend in Quill City. In his youth, he was an uncivilized and rebellious devil. Despite being a member of the Bailey Group, the wealthiest corporation in Quill City, he was cast out as the black sheep of the family and was dead broke.\n\nLater, his parents could not stand it anymore and made a plan for him to study abroad. He refused without hesitation. Instead, he relied on the prize money he got from a gaming tournament and simply enrolled himself in a vocational school.\n\nSuch a self-destructive person suddenly changed at the age of twenty.\n\nLorenzo became extremely hard-working. He diligently went to class and hung out in the library. He would also dress up and leave the dormitory at around six o'clock every morning. He rode the bicycle for an hour to Quill City Fine Arts Academy for lectures.\n\nSome people claimed that he had fallen in love with a student from Quill City Fine Arts Academy.\n\nNot long after, he wanted to start a company. His family was not supportive, of course. So, he put a knife to Grandpa Bailey\u2019s throat and grabbed 300 million to open a jewelry company, registered as Cherr.y.\n\nAt that time, the Baileys thought that the 300 million was burned for good. However, Cherr.y turned out to be unexpectedly successful. It made ten times the profit in its second year. In the fourth year, it was listed in Newford.\n\nToday, the \u2018Black Sheep\u2019 was a self-made man and had become the heir to the Bailey Group. Cherr.y had become a world-renowned jewelry brand.\n\nAs soon as Lorenzo sat down on the sofa, a group of beauties quickly came over and said, \"Mr. Bailey!\"\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nThe women trembled in fright and scurried away. Two more men sat down and said, \"Lorenzo, what pissed you off at home?\"\n\nLorenzo kept quiet. He picked up a glass and started chugging.\n\nThe others did not say anything anymore. They picked up their glass to drink with him.\n\nNot a moment later, someone's cell phone rang on the table.\n\n\"Xavier, your phone!\"\n\nA handsome man with platinum blond hair sat up on the sofa in a dark hidden corner.\n\nXavier woke up from his nap and scratched his tattooed neck. He took a look at his cell phone and his eyes widened.\n\n\"Lorenzo,\" he looked at Lorenzo, \"Why is Sydney calling me?\"\n\nLorenzo paused mid-drink and looked at Xavier. \"Who?\"\n\nXavier walked up to him with his cell phone, \"Your wife!\"\n\nLorenzo's expression turned sinister. \"When did you get her number?\"\n\nXavier said casually, \"On the day you both got married, I gave her my number when we sang together in the karaoke bar.\"\n\nHearing that, Lorenzo stood up abruptly and grabbed Xavier's collar, \"Who asked you to give your number?\"\n\nXavier frowned, puzzled at his friend\u2019s sudden rage. He pushed Lorenzo's hand away, \"We were all having fun, what\u2019s the big deal in exchanging contact information?\"\n\nLorenzo got angry. \"WHY\"\n\nWith that, he punched the undefended Xavier.\n\nXavier was caught off guard and slammed onto the marble table. The wine and glasses on the table clattered onto the floor.\n\nThe atmosphere froze. Lorenzo's eyes turned red like a furious beast. He growled, \"Delete her number!\"\n\nXavier was no sitting duck either. He was the second generation of the Altmans, an old money family in Quill City.  He was the prodigal son of the Altmans, a notorious troublemaker. He could hang out frequently with Lorenzo because they were similar.\n\nXavier wiped the bleeding corner of his lips and punched Lorenzo in return. \"What's going on, Popeye? Use your words, not your fists!\"\n\nLorenzo was hit on the head. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then he grabbed Xavier, pressed him on the sofa and beat him in a frenzy. \"How many times have you contacted Sydney in the past two years?!!\"\n\nXavier dodged Lorenzo's heavy punches and said, \"Why would I contact your wife like I have nothing else to do?! Have you gone mad? I'll admit you to the mental hospital!\"\n\nThese words seemed to hit a nerve. Lorenzo paused. \n\nHe was stunned for a few seconds. Then, he sat down on the side and then closed his eyes to quell the anger in his heart.\n\nXavier sat up, frowned and rubbed his shoulders. Vulgarities spewed.\n\nLorenzo ignored Xavier. After a while, he calmed down. He opened his eagle eyes and scanned the other men in the room, \"Who else saved her number?\"\n\nImmediately, several men lowered their heads to look for their phones.\n\nLorenzo was startled.\n\nImmediately, terrifying sounds of broken bottles filled the space, as well as Lorenzo's angry swear words, and screams of women as they dodge shards of glass.\n\nLorenzo seemed to have lost his mind and started attacking all his friends.\n\nXavier stepped outside with his cell phone and returned Sydney\u2019s call.\n\nWhen Sydney picked up, Xavier humbly said, \"Hi, Sydney. What's the matter?\"\n\nSydney's voice was gentle and polite. \"Xavier, I'm sorry to bother you. Lorenzo got a little upset with me tonight. He blocked me and I can't contact him. I wanted to ask if you know where he is.\"\n\nChapter 0003\n\"He was drinking with me, and now he's drunk and acting crazy. I'll send him back to you later. Don\u2019t worry.\"\n\nSydney paused for a moment then said, \"Can you give me the address? I want to check on him myself.\"\n\nXavier took a deep breath, opened the door and saw the chaos inside. He said, \"Melon, A.\"\n\nAbout ten minutes later, apart from Lorenzo and Xavier, everyone else left.\n\nLorenzo sat on the sofa. He stared at the chandelier on the ceiling, lost in thoughts.\n\nXavier sat next to him, \"We are not a part of your drama with Sydney. If anything, go home and solve it with her. Don't go crazy here.\"\n\nLorenzo closed his eyes. \"I\u2019m not going home.\"\n\n\"You must,\" \"Then tell me what happened between you two, I\u2019ll find a way for you.\"\n\nLorenzo, \"You can't.\"\n\n\u201cFine,\" Xavier said, \"If you won't go home, where will you go later?\"\n\n\"Chelsea will pick me up.\"\n\nXavier was stunned for a moment. \"Are you okay? You got so anxious when your wife called me. And now you\u2019re going to see another woman?\n\n\"I met you late. I don't know what happened between you and Sydney. You left her alone for two years, acting like you really don't care. However, we are not allowed to keep her contact information. What on earth are you thinking?\"\n\nLorenzo became impatient again. \"Boy, don\u2019t meddle with adult matters.\"\n\nWhen Xavier started to curse, a creaking sound came from the door. The two of them looked towards the door.\n\n\u201cEnzo,\u201d A sweet voice came.\n\nThe woman had the body of a devil and the face of an angel as she slithered in. She was the \u2018Nation\u2019s Goddess\u2019 and top tier actress, Chelsea Dune.\n \nLorenzo's expression finally softened a little when she appeared. \"Here she comes.\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows subtly.\n\nChelsea elegantly sat next to Lorenzo while avoiding the mess on the ground. She saw the cut at the corner of his eye.\n\nThe woman frowned. \"Why are you hurt?\"\n\nLorenzo said, \"It's nothing. I just drank too much.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt?\" As she spoke, Chelsea reached out and took Lorenzo's arm.\n\nXavier said with a smile, \"Hey Superstar, do you know he is married?\"\n\nChelsea paused and retracted her hand in embarrassment. \"Enzo and I are just friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, cool.\"\n\nLorenzo seemed displeased with Xavier's sarcasm towards Chelsea. He retorted, \"What are you trying to say?\"\n\nXavier stuck his tongue in his cheek and stood up with a grin. \"Nothing. Things among you guys are too complicated for my little brain. I\u2019m gonna go home to bed.\"\n\nAs soon as Xavier reached the door, the door was opened from the outside.\n\nXavier paused.\n\nSydney stood timidly at the door.\n\nShe was timid but she was objectively eye-catching.\n\nHer long, dark and wavy hair draped casually down her back. She had light makeup on her delicate and pretty face. Her lips were as bright as cherry, with a hint of sparkle.\n\nThe velvet, burgundy strappy dress contrasted with her flawless, snow-white skin. She was like a blooming red rose in the dark night.\n\nXavier gulped. He forgot how to speak at that moment.\n\nLorenzo's voice was suddenly heard. \"Who\u2019s there?\"\n\nXavier was stunned,and stepped aside to make way for Sydney. After Sydney entered the room, he exhaled and came back to his senses.\n\nAs soon as Sydney reached the door, she froze.\n\nEveryone had left. The private room had the brightest lights turned on. Right in the middle, Lorenzo and Chelsea were sitting together with their arms touching each other. To Sydney, that scene hurt her eyes more than the light.\n\nHer breath was stuck in her throat. Her lips quivered, but she could not say a word.\n\nLorenzo had an affair with Chelsea, her college bully!\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Lorenzo frowned, \"Go back!\"\n\nSydney shuddered then finally took a step. She quickened her pace.\n\nShe went up to the two of them. While everyone was caught off guard, she slapped Chelsea across the face and grabbed her hair. \"It's you!\"\n\nChelsea screamed, \"Ah! Enzo, help me!\"\n\n\u201cSydney!\u201d\n\nWhen Lorenzo spoke, Sydney let go of Chelsea. She raised her hand towards Lorenzo, but did not strike him.\n\nHer hands trembled. She broke down and shouted, \"You clearly know what she did to me back then! Of all the people, why her?!\"\n\nSuddenly.\n\nSlap!\n\nChelsea took advantage when Sydney was unguarded and slapped her back. That slap was even harder than Sydney\u2019s.\n\nSydney felt ringing in her ears, and then blood dripped from the corners of her lips.\n\nChelsea snarled, \"Why blame others if you can't keep your man?!\"\n\nSydney held her face. Her eyes turned red at Chelsea\u2019s smug expression. She shouted, \"I'm taking your life. \n\nShe tried to attack Chelsea again, but Lorenzo stopped her. He grabbed the back of her head and threw her to the other side of the sofa.\n\n\"I told you to go back, are you deaf?\"\n\nSydney felt as if she had gone deaf. The ringing in her ears was so severe that she couldn't hear what Lorenzo said. Half of her head was throbbing.\n\nAt this moment, Chelsea suddenly covered her ears and wailed, \"Enzo, I can't hear!\"\n\nLorenzo was shocked, \"You can\u2019t hear?\"\n\nChelsea's eyes widened in pity, and her cries became louder. \"I can't hear what you said...\"\n\nLorenzo looked back and glared at Sydney fiercely. He stood up, arms over Chelsea and walked out, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier, saw Lorenzo escorting a tearful Chelsea out of the room. He knew something was amiss and quickly entered the room.\n\nSydney closed her eyes and clasped her head with her hands. She fell sideways on the sofa. Her shoulders shook.\n\nAt the moment, half of that bright and charming face was as pale as paper, and the other half was marked with an angry palm print. The blood on the corners of her lips stood out even more.\n\nXavier's eyes widened and he rushed over. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney did not respond.\n\nXavier nudged her gently. \"Sydney!\"\n\nSydney then opened her eyes, her voice fading away, \"My, my ears hurt...\"\n\nWith the slap mark and her ear hurting, Xavier immediately understood what had happened. He helped Sydney up and said, \"Let's go to the hospital!\"\n\nSydney only managed to take two steps before her legs gave way. She was about to crash.\n\nPeople lose strength when they cannot bear the pain. Sydney would rather die than have Lorenzo cheated on her with Chelsea.\n\nXavier felt a pang of distress. He carried Sydney in his arms and hurried out.\n\n\u2026\n\nLorenzo and Chelsea stopped outside the main entrance of Melon. He said, \"Wait for me here, I'll get the car.\"\n\nChelsea held him and said, \"Enzo, I'm better now. I don\u2019t think I need to go to the hospital. Come with me and stay with me, okay?\"\n\nLorenzo frowned, and just as he was about to agree, something behind Chelsea attracted his attention.\n\nXavier carried Sydney and walked quickly towards the parking lot.\n\nLorenzo frowned, \"Since you don't need to go to the hospital, you should go back to the hotel first.\"\n\nWith that, he turned to chase after Xavier, but Chelsea pulled him back. \"Are you going to look for Sydney? How could she treat you like that but you still can't let her go?\"\n\nChapter 0004\nLorenzo's eyes darkened. He did not answer and strode after Xavier.\n\nChelsea exhaled forcefully. Her shoulders trembled. She looked at Sydney and Xavier with clear hatred and jealousy.\n\nHowever, Lorenzo did not manage to intercept Xavier. When he passed by, Xavier's car drifted gorgeously before merging onto the main freeway.\n\n\u2026\n\nInside the car.\n\nSydney crumpled into a ball and leaned against the car window. Xavier fastened the seat belt for her.\n\nTears streamed down her face the whole time, but she was expressionless, like a soulless sculpture.\n\nThe pain in her ear strained the nerves across her head, and pulled out many memories that she did not want to recall.\n\nA group of heavily made-up girls surrounded her. The proudest one leading the pack, was Chelsea, the one with the harmless face.\n\nHer smile was pure evil. She pulled Sydney\u2019s hair, and let her companions take turns to slap her. Chelsea dripped melted white ice cream on Sydney\u2019s face and chest.\n\nSydney dared not resist because her grandmother, Mary Collins, was in the hands of Christopher, Chelsea's father.\n\nThe Dunes were quite wealthy. Christopher owned a ceramics company, and Mary used to work as a cleaner in Christopher\u2019s office building.\n\nMary had always done a good job, but that day Chelsea insisted that Mary accidentally destroyed her father's documents. Even a fool knew that it was all a farce.\n\nSydney was a freshman that year and Chelsea was a sophomore.\n\nAt the Quill City Fine Arts Academy, Chelsea had always been the most sought-after goddess by many in the school. After Sydney entered the school, she stole Chelsea\u2019s glory.\n\nJealousy was written all over Chelsea's innocent face.\n\nChelsea took those humiliating photos and made Sydney look cheap. Soon, other people's harsh words tormented her as well.\n\nSydney, you are so pretty. If You planned turns a resentful woman,would your grandma still need to be a cleaner in her old age to support the family?\n\n\"Sydney! Hey, Sydney!\"\n\nXavier's words pulled her back from her thoughts.\n\nShe turned her head blankly to be met with a pair of gentle, concerned eyes.\n\nXavier saw her motionless and thought she had died with her eyes wide open.\n\nThe speed of the car was fast, and the pressure on her back felt comfortable. Sydney took the pills earlier and felt better because her discomfort was suppressed. Her ears still hurt but she could hear clearly.\n\n\"Xavier, thank you.\"\n\nXavier breathed out, \"As long as you're fine.\"\n\nSydney continued to be silent.\n\nIt was already four o'clock in the middle of the night. There were very few cars on the road.\n\nAfter Xavier turned a corner, he looked back at her.\n\nHis Adam's apple rolled quietly once more.\n\nSydney looked bright and charming from the front, but she looked even more striking with her smooth facial outline and high nose from the side. Her thick eyelashes were naturally curled; It felt like she was God\u2019s favorite.\n\nSydney stood out even among beauties and was considered stunning. She was spotted by a talent scout when she hit puberty in her first year of high school.\n\nHowever, her mother refused to allow her to enter the entertainment industry, so she had been keeping her head down at school. Initially, her mother had strict requirements. Sydney was not allowed to have long hair or wear nice clothes.\n\nThroughout high school, she had ugly short hair and wore puffy, outdated and tacky clothes. She was bullied when she started dressing up in college. It was not until she fell in love with that Black Sheep Enzo that she began to step out of her shell because she had someone to protect her.\n\nXavier broke the silence in the car again. \"You knew that all the boys have only known Lorenzo in the past three or four years. Am I right to say that you and Lorenzo have known each other for a long time?\"\n\nWith that, Sydney said, \"Yeah, he was my first love. I dated him when I was a freshman. He stayed with me throughout my college days for four years. We broke up when I graduated...\"\n\n\"After two years of separation, the elders in our respective families crossed paths by accident, and they arranged for us to get married for some reason. I was willing to get married, but he was not.\"\n\nXavier frowned. \"Do you...love him very much?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Sydney\u2019s voice trembled again, \"He used to be... very good to me. Extremely good.\"\n\nShe was deeply caught up by their love, whereby a simple sentence could dig up those heavy and profound memories.\n\n\"I don't have a father. Lorenzo not only gave me the sense of security that a boyfriend should, but he was protective like a father.\n\n\"For every holiday, others are picked up by their parents, but Lorenzo picked me up. At every start of the school season, parents would send their kids to class, but Lorenzo would send me. The day before school started, he would help me check my luggage. He would make sure I had everything I needed. He would also secretly put money into the pockets of my clothes.\u201d\n\nSydney's tears rolled down her cheeks again as she recalled those memories.\n\nXavier tightened his grip on the steering wheel. His expression became heavy. He did not expect Lorenzo to have such a tender and considerate side.\n\nHowever, tenderness and consideration were the most fearful things in a relationship because trying to move on after a breakup was tantamount to chipping away at the bones.\n\nAfter a moment, Xavier spoke, \"You are now... relying on his past kindness to you to support your marriage.\"\n\nThis sentence summed up her lonely married life for the past two years. Sydney lifted her hand and wiped her eyes, \"I am not willing to lose him. We were so good together; I really can't accept the current situation...\"\n   \n\nXavier said, \"But Sydney, have you ever thought about it? Many couples who have been estranged were once deeply in love in the past. You\u2019ve been tormenting yourself by living in the past. You will definitely meet a man who treats you better in the future.\"\n\nSydney sobbed, \"I tried moving on, but I still can't get over...\"\n\nXavier raised his eyebrows and changed his approach. \"Chelsea hit you, but he took Chelsea away without concern for you. Can you bear it?\"\n\nSydney was stunned for a moment. The hidden deep affection in her eyes was immediately replaced by hatred as her emotions flared up.\n\n\"No, I told Lorenzo from the start that anyone who is friends with Chelsea is my enemy. Did Lorenzo really have feelings for Chelsea, or did he do it deliberately to spite me...\n\n\"No, I can't think like that either,\" she began to mumble through her chaotic thoughts, \"No matter what his purpose is, if he really slept with Chelsea...\"\n\nShe did not continue, but closed her eyes and began to take deep breaths.\n\nSome scenes were just fantasies, but enough to suffocate her.\n\nXavier's heart ached a little when he saw Sydney in pain. At the same time, he was also curious about what happened between Sydney and Chelsea.\n\nJust as he was about to ask, his cell phone, which he had thrown inside the armrest storage, rang.\n\nHe looked down. It was a call from Lorenzo.\n\nXavier frowned, turned over his phone and clicked to hang up. He glanced in the rearview mirror again.\n\nBehind him was a flashy, black and red car, the world\u2019s rarest supercar. A toy owned by the richest man in Quill City.\n\nXavier looked at Sydney again. Her sobs could really melt a man's heart. He secretly gripped the steering wheel.\n\nIt was not Sydney who gave him her number first. The men, including him, noticed Lorenzo's indifference towards her, but were too captivated by her beauty, so they asked for it behind Lorenzo's back.\n\nOf course, they all found a perfect reason. They asked Sydney to leave her number, so they could contact her for business purposes.\n\nAt that time, no one dared to have filthy intentions. She was Lorenzo's legal wife, and Lorenzo was one of the most outstanding people among his friends.\n\nAside from the fact that Sydney was married, she was indeed a rare beauty. Everyone thought it was harmless to keep a beautiful woman\u2019s phone number.\n\nHowever, things were different now.\n\nHe swerved the steering wheel abruptly and turned around in the opposite direction. He accelerated to 200 miles an hour, and threw Lorenzo off his trail.\n\nChapter 0005\nXavier was driving dangerously fast, but his expression was exceptionally calm.\n\nIn addition to running several companies, he was also a part-time F2 racing driver.\n\nFor Lorenzo, the supercar was just a means of transportation, but in Xavier's hands, it was a toy. He was sure that Lorenzo would not be able to catch up.\n\nLorenzo watched Xavier's car zoom by his car like a ghost. He was stunned for a moment and quickly turned around. Two minutes later, he lost them.\n\nHe continued to call Xavier while flooring the accelerator, but still no one answered.\n\n\u2026\n\nXavier knew that he had other intentions when he ditched Lorenzo, but he dared not show it in front of Sydney right away.\n\nAfter all, she was still Lorenzo's wife. Xavier was one year younger than Lorenzo whom he regarded as his blood brother, so she was his sister-in-law, in a sense.\n\nHe took her to the hospital as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter the medical check-up to make sure there were no major problems, Xavier took Sydney back to Celestial Park after applying ice patches to her face.\n\nCelestial Park was a famous luxury residential area in Quill City. Sydney and Lorenzo bought their marital home here.\n\nAs soon as Sydney got to the bedroom, she saw Lorenzo sitting on the sofa at the end of the bed. There was a bottle of white wine on the round table next to him.\n\nSydney's eyes flashed. Without saying a word, she went to bed, lay down, and closed her eyes.\n\nA few seconds later, the man's footsteps were heard.\n\nSydney shivered. Her eyelashes became wet again.\n\nLorenzo suddenly got on the bed and pressed on her. She opened her eyes and started to push him away. \"Don't touch me...\"\n\nLorenzo paused, grabbed her collar with both hands, and tore her skirt apart.\n\nSydney's eyes widened with shock. Her screams echoed through the bedroom. \"Don't touch me with the hand you used to touch Chelsea Dune!\"\n\nLorenzo froze.\n\nSydney looked at him as tears poured down her face. \"I can have no dignity in front of you because we were dependent on each other for those four years. You provided a great deal for me, and you are also the closest person to me besides my mother and grandmother. My heart breaks for you because you were hurt by what happened back then. I can\u2019t bear to see you in deep pain every day because of me so I allow you to vent your grievances by hurting me!\n\n\u201cBut I can't share the same man with Chelsea, and I can't have the hand that touched her, touch me!!\n\n\u201cShe is the last straw of my dignity, Lorenzo!\"\n\nHowever, these words did not move Lorenzo to show any guilt.\n\nInstead, he became angrier. \"What about my last straw?\"\n\n\"I was disgusted by you too after Oliver touched you. What you do that night when we got registered?\"\n  \nSydney trembled. She choked.\n\nThat night.\n  \nHer mother and mother-in-law both wanted to seize the opportunity so that she and Lorenzo could have a child as soon as possible, so they tampered with their tea.\n\nLorenzo thought it was Sydney who Framed him.\n\n\"Why aren't you talking?\" Lorenzo's eyes were red as he stared into hers, \"Where did Xavier take you? He deliberately didn't answer my call. What did you do?\"\n\n\"Can you stop being suspicious of everyone and anyone? He took me to the hospital!\"\n\n\"Hospital?\" Lorenzo sneered, and he tightened his grip on her clothes, this time tearing her skirt all the way, \"Sydney, lift your legs for me!\"\n\nSydney panicked. \"What are you going to do?!\"\n\n\"Let's see if you betrayed me again!\"\n\nSydney immediately closed her knees together, \"I didn't!\"\n\nLorenzo pressed harder and his voice became more forceful, \"I don't believe a word you said!\"\n\nSuch stubborn words made Sydney lose the will to refute him.\n\nShe looked at Lorenzo\u2019s frightening and gloomy face and felt disgusted with him for the first time.\n\nShe reached out and pinched the back of his hand. \"Let me go, I'm tired, I want to sleep!\"\n\n\"I don't want to sleep, why should you sleep!\" Lorenzo was still furious. He did not seem to feel any pain in the back of his hand. The grip in his hand became stronger and stronger.\n\nHe pulled apart Sydney's knees quickly. He spread her legs apart so hard that even her behinds hurt.\n\nHe was worried that she would resist, so he pressed his knee on her belly and untied his belt.\n\nSydney's tears rolled to the side of her temples and wet the pillow. Still, she said nothing. Since pinching the back of his hand did not work, she pinched his neck hard.\n\nLorenzo winced in pain, but still did not let her go.\n\nIt felt as if he would not give up if he did not test her.\n\nLorenzo's neck,and even his arms and abdominal muscles were left bruised from Sydney's pinching while she gradually lost hope.\n\nShe wilted like dry roses, losing all trace of vitality.\n\nLorenzo endured the pain and tried to control her, but failed.\n\nSydney's tearful eyes trembled. Her hand squeezing his chest loosened, and she finally spoke again, \"Is that enough?\"\n\n\"Enough?\" Unexpectedly, Lorenzo felt even more enraged. He reached out and yanked open the drawer on the bedside table, took out the bottle of essential oil she bought, and then slammed the drawer shut!\n\nSydney seized this opportunity and tried to escape, but he grabbed her ankle in time. \"Be good!\"\n\nSydney stopped resisting. She knew she would not be able to escape tonight.\n\nShe was in tears, but she laughed. \"Lorenzo, I really didn't expect that one day I would be disgusted with you. Go ahead, disgust me more. So I can hate you enough, and give you what you want...\"\n\nShe thought, \u2018Lorenzo should know what I was referring to.\u2019\n\nIn the split second, her refusal to sign the divorce agreement suddenly wavered.\n\nDuring the time between being taken away by Xavier and being sent back home, she had been recalling the past.\n\nWhen she recalled the past with Chelsea, she did not want to lose her self-esteem. However, when she recalled every moment with Lorenzo, she did not want to regret losing the man she loved most.\n\nShe was deeply confused by these opposing feelings.\n\nHowever, right now, she actually felt disgusted with the man she loved most.\n\nShe was glad.\n\nDisgusted by him meant that she could finally let him go one day. \n\nLorenzo's face darkened at Sydney\u2019s words. He could not tell whether he was angry or something else.\n\nShe wanted to say more, but Lorenzo's lips suddenly covered hers.\n\nAt the same time, his fingertips of both hands trailed up along her waistline.\n\nThe faint smell of tobacco mixed with the fragrance and wine was an alluring masculine aroma. In the past, she could never resist his kisses.\n\nLorenzo was even wilder in the past than he is now. He was like a lion in the savanna. The passion and impulse he made her feel was strong and without restraint.\n\nApart from the four years they were separated, they had slept together for four years until now. He understood every part of her body, her preferred tension and pressure.\n\nSoon, her body reacted uncontrollably."
